Summary,Review,Rating
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Good place to work!,"After 26yrs, am happy with Walmart over all. Good hours, great benefits. Can move around with in the company. Management is good to associates. Great community involvement. ",5
High pressure retail.,You can move up or move out quickly all depending on whether or not your market manager or regional manager like you. One visit can change everything for the good or for the bad.,2
Heavy on tech – light on training. ,"Was saddled with a “trainer” who did not like training. Job went downhill from there. Was promised M-F, 8AM-5PM schedule, but after training got scheduled for weekends. When the pandemic hit, everyone started working from home. A year and 4 months later, when Walmart invited everyone to begin transitioning back to the office, our team was told we’d be working from home permanently. Great if you’re an introvert or don’t like being around people. Awful if you’re an extrovert or enjoy being around people. ",3
Customers,Customers tend to treat us like we are a second rate telemarketing company which we are not and can be rude and hateful and blame all their problems on billing Dept even if it’s a delivered order that was stolen from their home or bank issues that are not our fault. You must have tough skin to handle this job. ,5
Wealthy Company with a Poor Culture,It's somewhat difficult to explain but this company just can't figure it out at the corporate level. From mediocre salaries to old processes. Imagine a Tesla exterior with a Ford motor.,3
"Depending on your leadership, you can do extremely well or get railroaded out. Both happen just as quickly.","It's typical retail. There is a ton of upside if you get the right managers above you. There is a ton of downside if you get the wrong managers above you. The market managers and regional managers control your entire destiny based off of a couple of visits. That part is the most disappointing, but on the flip side, those couple of visits can catapult you to the top as well if they like you during them.",3
It’s far from okay,Definitely seems like there’s room to grow but you will constantly be overlooked for different positions and advancements. It’s really sad that a company that is so large has such little room for real growth,1
Something for Everyone ,Large company with a ton of room for advancement based on where you want to go. Family and work balance has greatly improved over the years and that’s a significant benefit ,4
They care about their employees if you need time off you can take it And that means everything,Busy all day makes the time go by super fastManagement is great and very helpful in learningReally the hardest part about my job is just showing up that’s it and dealing with grouchy customers from time to timeThe people there are great,4
Good pay and good benefits ,Worked in the home office for 4 years.Environment was good and pay was fair. Management is not always helpful as they sometimes don’t know how to adept to each person differently. Job security isn’t really there since they do lay offs so often.Overall good place to work just remember you are just a number. ,4
I had Terrible Manager ,"I was very excited to get a job in the Health and Wellness division and made some great friends in the field. But I wanted to advance and work in Optical, not Pharma where I was hired. After working for a year I tried to move over to Optical but my manager wants me to stay in Pharma and would not let me move. I am moved on and move away from Bentonville Arkansas but I would not recommend anyone go work there and move their family there for a job as they have a high turnover in senior management at the home office and because they phase your job out. This did not happen to me but to many of my friends. ",2
It's a great place to work,"Good pay, work life balance. There are some inconsistencies in work from home policy. Associates that have worked at Walmart for a year+ are not allowed to relocate and work remote, but some new associates are getting hired as remote. Feels like California employees get special treatment over Bentonville Associates.",4
You get to solve the largest technology problems in the world ,Great company with high expectations and the ability for anyone in the company to get to any position. The technology group is fun to work for and has a culture of continuous learning. Be prepared to work long hours as the company is transforming. ,4
Love it!,"Walmart managers are the best I've ever worked for. I have been through 3 management transitions and every manager was concerned about my happiness, stress levels and professional development",5
"Great culture, professional development available, amazing benefits",Best managers ever! I've been through management transition 3 times and all have been some of the best managers I've worked under. Walmart strongly encourages professional development and provides the tool chest and coaching to do so. ,5
Productive driven,"Flexible work schedule in some areas. Good teams if you can find your spot, but they don't want you to stay. They want you to improve your skill sets but also wants you to have daily task completed, no wiggle room.",4
Mixed Bag,The pay is competitive/ better than competitors. But non financial benefits are a more expensive and management does a poor job investing in their team ,3
Good place to learn,"Good place to learn about merchandising, retail and eCommerce. A bit impersonal as many massive companies are, but the flip side is there are massive opportunities to grow. Bentonville Arkansas is tough, but if you can get over that the pay is good and there are plenty of opportunities.",3
"Hard work , good benefits , high turnover.",Long hours and short breaks. Pay and benefits are all decent . The retention rate for new hires at these warehouses is incredibly low; don't be surprised if multiple co-workers quit sooner than you.,3
Horrible politics,"One person does 10 peoples work. They hire people in India to cut costs which means you are working in 2 opposite time zones. You can work your tail off but dare you rub someone the wrong way by even expressing an opinion that is different than yours and you can say bye bye to your job. The only good thing is work from home otherwise the work hours are ridiculous, politics is insane, culture is toxic and leadership has very fragile egos.",1
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Well paid but stressful,"You work on huge programs.  Direct managers generally are pretty good.  Hit or miss on the VP's, but executive leadership is pretty great.  Pay was good, but you pay for it through hours worked and stress.  I liked my colleagues.  ",3
Good transition job,I worked for Walmart information systems for a couple of years. I will state the pros and cons Pros:1. Big projects with huge ROI2. High maturity when it come to information systemsCons1. Pay is average or below even for IT Professionals. Consider the amount of out of pocket that you have to pay for healthcare2. Horrible health insurance. Walmart has catastrophic health insurance where alot of things are not covered. The premiums are not cheap.3. Alot of bad politics especially from management. 4. Expect to be laid off at anytime. Layoffs at headquarters happens very often for restructuring. The emotional stress is not worth it,1
Great Opportunity,Great company to work for. Challenging environments at time but the sky is the limit on what you can do. If you dedicate yourself and position yourself with the right leadership success will follow.,4
"Poor Management, Supervisors with attitiudes, ","Working at Walmart was one of those get your feet wet type of jobs. I enjoyed it at first, but quickly came to realize that Walmart was only about their money and nothing else. The management sucks, the pay sucks, and they have absolutely no care for your health or well being, They allowed Supervisors to lie and force you to work off the clock "" or you can quit"" There were times when you were gas lighted by a supervisor and it felt like you were in an abusive, manipulative relationship with your job.  LOTS of favoritism. ",1
Typical retail,Was an ok experience for my first job. Took this position right out of school. Always had IT request backlogged and customers how were upset about wait times.,4
Terrible HR department,"Walmart isn't the same anymore. Now, you are just a number, especially if you are hourly or entry level management. They work hard to give out the false sense that you matter, and that they (HR) care about you, but in reality they don't. Your coworkers and managers might actually care about you, but definitely not HR. You can be fire out of the blue without warning, without disciplinary action, and regardless of your performance.  ",2
productive and fun workplace with lots of overtime,work as an unloader and hauler. long hours on your feet but really good pay and management cares about you and wants you to succede the best you are able to ,4
Good place ,"Good place to work depending on managers. Walmart was very fun to work at but sometimes the managers would take advantage of you if they saw you working hard. Pushed a lot and bossed around but pretty much you get to vibe alone when you're a stocker, unless there's 2 people per",5
They don't care about the people,The only care about $$$$ . If you don't make the numbers that you need to make your fired. It's all about quality it's about shoving in the numbers and the orders as fast as possible.,1
You are just a number,"Walmart may pay well at the corporate level but that’s about as far as it goes. Your dedication and time mean nothing to them. They lay off consistently and cut positions. There is no loyalty with this company. While they embrace diversity now only after what has happened in this country, they don’t promote fairly regardless. Stay away from this place like the plague. ",1
Not my favorite job,Micromanaged to death and nit picked about everything.  I liked my manager and their bosses are great but the lower/middle management team are almost impossible to deal with.  Being the 3rd party employee made me an easy target to unleash corporate frustration on,3
"Great Coworkers, ","When I started was a great place to work for, hourly's were treated great, not so great now, dont really value their long term/loyal associates getting rid of jobs.",3
Horrible backstabbing management,"I used to be so pro Wal-Mart. Now I would not recommend them.  The core values of this company are wonderful, unless you get a manager that only speaks the values but doesn't practice them.  Sam Walton would be so dissapointed in seeing what he built turn sour with the management.",2
Walmart is stable,"Good company to work for but it isn't easy, you have to pay attention and in training you won't feel ready but they will still start you so you learn more as you start working.",4
Great place to work,"Not perfect by any means, but exciting environment, an amazing culture of respect and striving to be better every day. There is so much to learn about the company's efforts to become even more competitive!",4
Fortune 1 for a reason,I worked for Walmart for 5 years and during that time I had the opportunity to learn from and meet many noteworthy individuals. Working for Walmart is definitely like being part of a family. There is endless room to grow if you want. Walmart values their employees and makes it a point to help people understand the meaning of their work beyond a paycheck. ,5
I loved the people I worked with,"The negative was you we’re pretty-judged almost right away whether or not you were promotable and once written off, you were going nowhere.  They believe in working you in areas where you haven’t been prior and that creates a lot I’d really unqualified people who don’t know areas they are managing, but overall, there were many more quality managers than at many other corporate offices.There was a great deal of unfairness there.  Two of us did the work of 4 full time people.  I sadly had to leave.",4
Fun ,"Its ok company.  They lay off constantly. Good benefits, good people. You need to know people on order to grow in this company . I had a great Boss....",3
Great corporate culture,Leadership is very approachable and my work feels purpose driven. I feel like the work I do here has a big impact and I’m proud of what we’re doing as a company. ,4
Great company,Love the management and company. Easily move up in ranks. Great customer service and strong bonds. Would highly recommend employment to anyone looking for a job.,5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Walmart ,"It’s a good job, just not the place it is to be when Sams was alive, but the new drivers have to slip seat a couple times a week. New drivers will be starting their work week on the weekends. ",4
Imagine having a migraine everyday but it's a store.,If you think you can keep overtime if asked to stay late then never apply. If you like spending the holidays with your family then go somewhere else. If you hate doing other peoples jobs then leave immediately. Oh and if you miss high school drama then Walmart is the place of your dreams.,1
"Good Stopgap, But Don't Stay Too Long","Three-day work week, paid workout, able to wear whatever I want, water constantly available, huge safety measures. Good pay for those looking to enter the workforce but not the greatest pay.",4
company with good culture/Reorg every so months,"Overall, great company in the 17 years I worked there I learned a lot in the department I worked in. I remember individuals who had long careers and growth. However, that has changed and like many companies reorgs are plenty. In the last 10 years, Walmart has transformed itself from a homey large company to an international giant and competitor. As a minority that helped shape the culture too, it felt more inclusive. ",3
"Weak company culture, with little integrity","Management backing is just words. When the chips are down, management disappears.  The company demands mediocrity. I have never seen a single IT person that was allowed to do what they were best at. Careers are ruined in the first three years by keeping employees away from their interests. Your skills will be atrophied and you will not be able to leave Bentonville once that happens. The pay is great. Bonuses are fantastic.  If you can justify that to sell your career down the tubes, Walmart is perfect. If you have any creativity or ability, stay away. Keep your head down and make no mistakes. ",1
You are expendable,"They have no concern for you or your needs whatsoever, they do not work with you at all and the training was often incorrect and you could not actually help the store employee solve the problem they were calling about. The people that listened to your calls and review your performance all had their own set of requirements and scored you by them so you could never get it right. ",1
Great culture and great coworkers,"Good work life balance, incredibly nice and friendly coworkers. Good budget to do the work that I want to do. Great women’s network as well. Learned a lot while working there.",5
Great place to work,Great place to work. I've been with Walmart since I graduated in 2015. Been through three promotions in 5 years. Currently working as data scientist. My manager cares about me and helps me develop. ,5
"Great place to work, but very large",I worked here as an intern in the corporate office. I really enjoyed it. Lots of fun company activities and I loved how collaborative it was. Only downside is how big the company is and the feeling that promotions are increasingly political. It’s the unfortunate reality of being such a high profile and large company in 2020. ,5
Great Training and Good Management,"I worked here for about a year, and the training is awesome. Management is good. Cannot turn down promotions. Every time you receive a pay increase or promotion, you are ineligible to apply for another position within the company for at least 6 months, so do not expect to move up fast. ",4
busy,it was always busy but that wasn't always a bad thing you're day went by fast but management was terrible and they never seemed to be on the same page with each other ,3
Average Corporate Retail IT Job,"Depending on the team you land on you can have a great time or an awful time. The sad truth is that like any corporate, your manager will make or break your enjoyment of your job. Walmart also tries to say they are agile, but often than not, most teams end up doing Agil-fall, and pretend and present like they are agile, but crumple to business users needs and it ends up a bastardized Waterfall project. ",4
Long hours - micromanagement ,"If you want to feel like you're in kindergarten and have every little thing you do be watched by management, this is the place for you to work..if not move right along!",3
Depends where in the company you work at,Some areas of business are treated better than workers from the retail stores. There is more opportunity for advancement and wage increase in the home office than in the stores.,4
Pretty good place to work,"Overall, Walmart is a pretty good place to work, and depending on where within the company you're placed, your experience may be different for the better or worse.",4
Good job but bad management,Overall it’s a good company to work for there’s plenty of job opportunities you can move up in the company or you can stay at store level Walmart even does intern for students it’s also beneficial for people who have been with the company for a while it’s 401k is a good thing to have there are benefits for the part time associates,2
Loyalty is key,"You will work with amazing people and learn new things daily. However, retail is their business so compensation is probably 1/3 of the general market value for technical roles. Annual bonuses used to make up another 1/3 of that, but they have recently changed to making the amount and receipt at all performance based, so it is no longer guaranteed. If you’re confident your manager likes you, it will probably be fine. You’ll generally be working on older stacks and unsupported versions of everything. It is very common to be reassigned to another team our department or even role without being consulted or consenting. ",3
Just Bad!,"I wouldn't recommend working here. Management is bad, they don't respect their employees. Also the salary is a complete job, you can easily get terminated without notice",1
Not bad,I started as a temp technically working for an outside agency which wasn't great because it meant I had lower pay and no benefits but once I was hired directly by Walmart my situation improved. The work at the home office can be tedious in accounts payable but it wasn't particularly stressful.,3
Quality control,"Work-life balanceYou become family, they work with you in any situation.Pay & benefitsExcellentOverallI worked there for 15 years plus 1 year at the store and 10 years at the photo lab, you can advance quickly, transfer to any job you want, lots of opportunities.",5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
"Not a stable job, does not care for employees","Let's start off by saying Walmart treats the employees like they are disposable. Literally, rips the rug out from beneath them. Firstly, when the company changes direction (no warning just removes people from jobs). Secondly, you have no job security (none). Now let me say I understand a company changes and adapts, but they do this not caring about the people they affect. When I say affect, I mean you come into work and are walked into an office to be let go. They close stores like a hooker gets laid in New York. They take away they put back, but the people they trample on mean nothing. Want to know why because you my friend are just a number. You can be replaced by someone who will do it cheaper. It is so sad to see the Wal-Mart I used to know, turn into a greedy corporate mess. Literally Wal-Mart is a hot mess. Please just get a job somewhere else. I would rather work at a fast food chain than work for Wal-Mart. Seniority this means nothing, as well. Truth hurts Wal-Mart and I just stopped shopping here altogether. You can get your products somewhere else, probably better quality too. Please save yourself the trouble.",1
They like to get people out that have Tenor ,They well do away with the job that you have because of someone taking over in their main office because they want to make their mark they like change but only when they can think of it they do not listen to the associates ,2
Worst place anybody could work,"Managers will avoid you instead of helping you. Management has no idea how to manage and avoid their job requirements the whole time they are there. You can't move up, or around for that matter, and all the managers have inappropriate relations with minors. I had to quit because they wouldn't give me a transfer when I moved an hour from the store.",1
Low Pay for a lot of work,"Wal mart doesn't pay very well. Being such a large company you would think they would pay for quality workers. Working the meat frozen and dairy almost daily by myself, it sometimes becomes overwhelming. This job is definitely more for a high-school, college kid. If you are looking to make a career here I don't think this is the place. ",2
The people who show up for work everyday in spite of the pandemic and do their best to serve the customers well are the rock of this company. ,This company has the vision mission and values that compels me to continue my Servant leadership here. The messages that are communicated by upper level management. ,5
Everyone jumps in to help when a serious situation arises.,The work is demanding and can be taxing yet everyone jumps in to help when a serious situation arises.  Can be hard to let go and end your day.....People treat each other with respect for the most part.Management encourages solutions in lieu of complaints - i.e. don't bring up a problem unless you have a solution.,5
Great place to work,"Love and admire this company, always put this country and associates first.  The CEO is intune with the country and all  Wal-Mart associations.  It’s really a great honor to work for this company.",5
Very little job security but potential for growth,Many opportunities for advancement and new challenges. However time in chair requirement can cause you to be stuck in a job for a long time. Very little job security. Company has had multiple large restructures which displaces many individuals. Stress level is very dependent on team and part of the company. Generally a really good place to learn. ,3
Good,Great work culture with great innovative team. Good compensation along with stock options and health insurance along with 401k .World's biggest Retail company and biggest employer and cross functional team working exp is valuable,4
I enjoyed my team but being contract for a 12 month project that went for 15 months I felt I was not sure any longer of my faith in leader,"I really loved my job but was a Temporary Contract with all positive reviews and comments for permanent role.  I waited 3 months after my 12 month contract and the lag time became stressful.  No perks, bonus PTO etc.  I am sorry and I have great references but just my leadership lacked strength in my humble opinion.",3
The settlement position,"Alot of steps in the process Alot of communication with suppliersMust be detail orientedMust be organizedTeam atmosphere was greatWork schedule was flexible",2
Ok Place to work,Depending on where you are working for Walmart it can both be a fantastic place and a little bit of rough the all in all it's a good job to have good management,3
Fun working for and feel like we were all a big family,Walmart was good to work for friendly family oriented n cared about there associates. Since times are changing we were out sourced to Genpact  Wish they had never gone in that direction ,5
good,Good benefits. New structure of the systems that they change the job codes of the job. Hired new people without experience and train them. Days off are split,3
A lot to learn,Wonderful hours and my coworkers were the best. I learned a lot about billing and speaking to vendors. I was able to speak to Hr without worrying about anything.,5
Productive,"Nice place to work, good work life balance.  Lots of travel involved with some positions.  Sometimes work life balance is tested however pretty strict.  Good people to work for and definitely a great company",4
Terrible,They only care about you as a cog in their big corporate machine. The constant propaganda you're subjected to will make you numb. The florescent lights mess up your sleep schedule.,1
Awesome Company,Awesome Company and i would love to work for  this company. office culture was great and we can learn new technologies and always inspiring work culture ,5
it's okay job,like the people i work with my place very fast paced all about meeting the metrics even when understaffed good team effort was easy for me to advance mainly cause of work ethic i show up and work hard,3
Most toxic environment I have worked in over the last 35 years of my career,"I bought into the whole people friendly company that believed in work life balance. I have never worked in a more toxic environment. Much of this was do to my management and that when I spoke up about the issue, I was fired.",1
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Reviewing,Typical workday 8-5:30 but during busy time of the month be prepared to work u til the job is done. Work life balance is not great several nights working past 6,2
Bad management.,"Everyday it is something new. People who are over aggressive get away with whatever they want, like a sense of entitlement. They can push management to not do their jobs and push it onto others. Eventhough there is a one best way no one is allowed to follow it. No accountability.",1
Worth the experience,I loved working here and my job duties. The only con i had was that some coworkers liked to complain and management didnt stoo them and often repromanded the wrong people.,4
Walmart cares about the costumers!,Walmart can be a great place to work! They care about the costumers. They want you to be able to be yourself at work. Sometimes you will run into associates/managers who will not treat you right and that is why Walmart has the “open door policy” for me at my job location the open door policy is a great thing!,3
Working conditions within the company,"The most disappointing thing about walmart is there are cliques that work against good workers.People don't like to see others get ahead.The most enjoyable part of my time there was meeting new people in other stores.",3
Terrible company to work for if you’re a temp.,"They really don’t care for the temps when it comes to advancement, benefits or compensation. Leadership is a joke and Open communication doesn’t exist.",1
Private contract,Poor culture and communication. I was unable to work hands on with company leaders to extend the contract and had many inquiries passed over. It was a great but daunting experience.,3
Excellent place to work.,Walmart has an inclusive culture like no other.  The opportunities  and possibilities are endless.  They have great leadership that work to grow and promote their people.  I started my career with Walmart very young and was able to promote and grow with the company for many years.  I strongly recommend working at Walmart who wants to succeed in their career.,5
It was a really great place to be.,"The work-life balance was excellent, and I absolutely loved my managers when I worked there.  I think they really had me work on some important projects, and it never felt like I was rushed or anything was overbearing, and I wish I could've been there longer. My only issue was that because it was around the end of the financial quarter, they had to make some cuts when I had only been contracted under them for a couple of months, so it was really disappointing that  they had to let the contractors on our team go, but I loved my time there.",5
Great learning experience as a store remodeler,"All over Management needs management training in all areas...the local tech schools offer excellent Manager and leadership training courses, also more hands on training and better communication skills would be helpful",3
Everyone is always getting each other,"At Walton neighborhood Walmart everyone is always happy to help each other and greet without fail. The bad is sometimes it is hard to get a hold of HR but that is because they are very busy.",4
Csr,Working as a CSR at Walmart I felt overall like I was making a difference not only in customers lives but also in the workplace. I loved my job; there are many days I wish I could go back. Also some days are better then others don’t let that discourage you. But one piece of advice I can give is keep your head down and just focus on your job. Rumors fly around at warp speed there. It’s the reason I left.,5
Nice to work,"I had a good learning experience. Work Life balance is good.Many options to explore internally for a Software Engineer.But, bit outdated with technology and ways of doing things.",4
Bad company,"I had a very bad experiencePeople don't have ethicsPeople are illtreatedlot of discrimination between associates and contractorsno sense of belongingnessbad management",1
Great College Job,For a college kid still in school it was a great job. The task where very easy to accomplish each day and you felt like you where just spinning the wheel that makes Walmart move.,3
Good company to work,Nice environment and very flexible for people to work and mostly encouraging people and takes up the tasks based on the priority. Long working hours but flexible in most of the times,5
"Fun place, great environment and friendly scrum master.","It was an amazing place to work specially the team members, leads, scrum master and everybody was very helpful and friendly. Whoever seeking to work here will not have any issue.",5
"Productive, Customer Friendly, fun place to work","I have been a part-time employee at Walmart for almost 9 years. I've seen a lot of change. Some of the change seems good and some seems questionable. But at the end of the day, I like working for Walmart a lot.",4
Productive and fun workplace,A lot of room to grow and different areas to learn and expand skill set. Different teams and great workplace environment. Huge work space and giant facility. Great company and good people.,5
Great place if you are workholic.,"Great place if you are workaholic. Especially if you are in IT and work for any major project like NEX Gen pricing. I had a great time working here, learnt a lot and all tasks were challenging. working one year is equivalent to working 5 years for the sake of experience and exposure.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Company cares about associates and customers,"During this tough time, Walmart has shown that it cares about its associates as well as its customers.  It has stepped up on many fronts over the years.",5
productive,"A typical day as a pharmacy technician: There are many areas you must work during the course of a day.  The technicians must rotate from filling prescriptions to inputting the prescriptions to working at the counter serving the patients.  Being precise is key. The hardest part is, there is no room for mistakes while working with medication for a patient.  While we are working under the direction of the Pharmacist a technician  must also be aware that mistakes could cost the health of a patient.  Depending on which pharmacy one is working in, it can be fast pace. The phone never stops ringing. Most prescriptions are done now electronically rather than called into by the doctors office. Many changes have been made to enhance patient safety.",4
Great company with Great culture.,"Great culture. Many different growth opportunities to pursue. Mentorship available. Northwest Arkansas is a great place to live, and getting better. Opportunity to feel good about what you do, each day.",4
Plenty of work but little work life balance,They pay well and have a great culture. The culture is eroding with managers and higher level leaders who don't align with Sam Walton's vision anymore.,2
Be prepared to find another job without much notice,their upper management is so arrogant that they are the #1 company that there is no room for improvement.  drink the kool-aid or get out.  there is constant change in org structure,2
"Sometimes monthly birthdays, employee anniversaries are celebrated, and on rare occasions ""associate of the month"" gets recognized","Tasks are generally according to area assignment with additional tasks varying. Hours sometimes get changed, reduced,or schedules get rearranged according to necessity. Associates are required to be flexible to sudden task changes.",3
WalMart is an Innovative company and is a wealth and health bank of growth and opportunities,"Great place for a first job, first Customer Service experience;for building business development management skills, great flexibility for second job-ers, retirees, and homemakers. It also can be a fun place to work as you greet and meet a diversity of customers and people.",5
Ethics,"Family oriented, ethics, and consistently treat the employees fairly. Management is engaged with team members and provide exceptional mentors to promote from within.",5
Driven by numbers,"A typical day at work, check email and respond. Work the critical propriety list down to the lowest priority. I learned adaptability while working in the temporary department and flexibility with all the changes. Management is great when not micromanaging others. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in an open area.",3
Great culture within the InfoSec department,"Walmart has been a fantastic place to build my Cyber Security career. The culture of the company is well represented and the work life balance is excellent.",5
Corporate Eval,It has many ups and several downs. The main issue is immediate managers. When you have a bad one it sucks. Bad means = no values and will throw you Under the bus to save face. There should be manager Evaluations.,3
It is what you make of it.,"Like any company I had good Managers and bad. The beauty if WalMart is if you don’t like you boss or the job you are doing , transfer elsewhere. I will tell you you will run across some poor managers from time to time, however they don’t last long.",4
They dont care about employees at all,This company only cares about the bottom dollar. The walmart that Sam Walton started is no longer alive!!! Stay away if you value your life and career.,1
All work no Play,"Very political work environment. Must be there early and work late. If you aren't brown nosing with upper management, you likely will never advance in this company",1
Poor poor management,They literal set me up to fail. Management is suppose to manage not be a person social club. They also insulted the way I look at every point they could make. Terrible.,1
Good to work in large retail comp,"Good to work in large retail company, good opportunities. Well recognitions. Performed auditd, SOX compliences with out any  findings. ENjoyed working here.",5
No job security,they will change corporate direction and dissolve job positions without warning . They do not reward hard work like many other companies. You are just a number to them,2
I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone,Have worked for this company twice. Both times I was fired from the company just before hitting my 5 year mark. Both times I was not given a reason for being fired.,2
It's not a good place to work for.,The management is horrible. Only care about themselves. You try and work with them on hours and work but a lot of the time they act like they care but in reality they don't.,3

It is based on production,"not everyone is cut out to work in a distribution facility Not everyone can make productionsummers are really hot winters are really cold the pay is fair",4
Good Entry Level Position,"Working during the Christmas season was challenging. However, you are given the necessary tools and authority to solve problems for the client. If you like helping people you can be a hero for the customer. However, sometimes there is nothing you can do and the customers can be a bit abusive so you have to be ready for that. After the Christmas rush, the job is a breeze.",4
NO way to grow,Even though walmart says that we can grow by switching teams but some teams won't let you move. Also to grow you have get out of the company and join back again.,3
Management conflict,Management had too much miscommunication between themselves and it started affecting basic work. Walmart also has trouble with working with you on your schedule from my experience,3

Productive working with different people to accomplish a task,"I would have a daily meeting with my team and we would discuss safety/ workload for the day and cover any concerns, comments or questions that the team would have.  After the meeting the team would work on the task that was given for the day.  We would try to complete the daily task everyday so we would be on target and finish the project on time. I also would work with the construction company and the store during the entire project so there would be no misunderstanding with the scope of work.  I also would make my own phasing plans if the project was a Special Project to complete on time with the allotted amount  of people assigned to the project.",5

Ex employee,Not all managers walk the talk. But it is a wonderful place to work if you are self motivated.  Find trusted mentors and sponsors..who can speak for you when you are not in the room.,4
You need to make production,They have programs that help when your loved ones are ill.they expect you to do your job and make production. They are strict on tardiness and missed days,4
I miss working there it’s a good place to work you meet all sorts of people,I liked working there it was a good job and you got to meet a diversity of people.everyone got treated the same and with respect no one ever got treated unfairly,5

productive and fun working place,"Great place to work,learned  technical information from the workplace, people are more collaborative helping nature inside the teams, strongly suggest for the developers to work here.",5
Stable company with many different jobs,"System engineer is probably like system engineer at other companies. You receive requirements, are assigned coding tasks or support tasks on an agile board, and you fulfill those tasks by code or other ways. Your project may be small or very large. Technology is usually split by what your area does. So you may be a part of Supply Chain or Store systems, etc. Those teams are grouped together as they are similar. The hardest part of the job is the red tape as a large company is very bloated. Your daily tasks may require multiple hoops to jump through to get work done. There will be constant barriers for you to be able to do your job, and with each passing year, there will be even more red tape until you want to scream. The common phrase at Walmart is going ditch to ditch. Like they will do something and that puts everyone in the metaphorical ""ditch"", then they change it and it goes into another ditch the opposite way. Walmart wants development to be agile, but prepare yourself for resistance to be able to be agile, if you ever would be. Tech at Walmart also implemented a bell curve in evaluations. This means if you had a good year, but everyone else on your team is perceived as having a better year, you will not receive a raise and will be deemed as development needed. This has created an environment of nitpicking and finding reasons not to promote, and not to give you a raise. Even if your technical skills are fantastic, your programming and code is amazing, one teeny tiny detail of your year may ruin your whole evaluation. The best part of the job is you usually have a direct - more...",3

Diverse work atmosphere,"Working at Walmart in multiple positions gave me opportunity to learn more about the company and get experience in different areas.It was an great opportunity.",4
No support for the associate,"I use to enjoy working for this company.  It has changed a lot and not for the better of the associate.  If you cannot pull pallets, lift bags of dog food or forget about your family life, then this is the company for you.  Good luck in you endeavors.",2
"Left because of management, loved the job.","Management was too overbearing and would micro manage and often criticize as well.  At times would make others feel incompetent and unworthy. I loved working at Wal-Mart, however my manager drove me away.",4
"Very productive, family friendly, and inclusive place to work but do wish I was compensated a bit more.","Let me start off by saying that this a great company to start your career. It has both nurtured me and given me the tools and environment to succeed. My job as a Technical Project Manager has given me a lot of pride but also a lot of stress. Accomplishing tasks day to day can be very productive but when larger initiatives come into play due to Walmarts size things can be slow. Sometimes politics come into play as with any corporate company. Additionally, what I don't like is that time in position comes into play when looking at promotions and not just strictly off merit and effort. Also, getting certifications and going for more classes is very encouraged and most of the time Walmart pays for it. Lastly, the end of the fiscal year bonus is nice, as long as you have a good evaluation.",4
Overall great company,"I feel like not only does the company care about the customers which they do put first, but they also take care of their employees. I really enjoyed my time working for the home office and if I ever get an opportunity I would do it again.",5

Culture of lies and misinformation.,"I worked for this company for 5 years and it took a while to see where the the space between what they preach and how the upper management acts. It really is all who you know, who you date and who your friends are.  If you are not willing to bend to that sort of behavior, you might want to find someplace else. They will tell you to your face something isn't happening (like moving a entire department's jobs over seas or to a 3rd party) then they do it anyway.",2
Ok Company,Ok company to work for. Not the greatest benefit. Lack of job security and outdated technology. Very poor number of vacation/sick days. Location is very undeveloped,3
Excellent Company to work for!,"Great compensation, great benefits, Honest and Good people to work. Employee advancement seems to be a big goal for the company. the diversity and team work is immaculate!",5
Fantastic Growth Opportunities,This job is very rewarding and well worth applying for! The culture and work ethic of this company is enough to make you feel at home while still being challenged to being something new to the table every single day. The scale at which you operate is unbelievable and you will learn so much within just your first 6 months.,5
Challenging work environment with great associates,"Some of the finest people,I have ever worked with. You are challenged daily to do more than you ever thought you could and are recognized by your team for your accomplishments",4
"Good for experience, but don't get stuck",Walmart is a tremendous place to build experience and knowledge. The limitation is that only playing through the office politics games will you be able to advance past the lowest levels of management.,3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
It was a job,"Hired as a temporary, get your foot in the door, hope of a full time job didn't materialize. Training was inadequate and role expanded with out any training.",3
family oriented and fair with wages and opportunity.,Worked there 26 years and was treated fairly and wages were very good. Family always came first and you were given the time off when needed. I learned all about medical insurance and all the benefits offered. The management were always good to me and helped me advance when I wanted to. The hardest part of the job was having to tell the associate that their claims were paid correctly and the owed money. The best part was the friendships you make for life.,5
Walmart is focused on diversity and sustainability,"Walmart is a leader in the industry to be inclusive and diverse.  A worldwide retailer that seeks to meet customers needs in every market they operate.  Additionally, Walmart is a leader in sustainability striving daily to reduce waste.

My review,If it was easier to get hired on with the company instead of being a temp employee for my entire Walmart career. The good was that I gained a ton of experience that will help me with finding a lasting career.,5
Great place to work,Good work life balance. Always pushed family first in the division of the company I worked in. We were a close group of teams out in the field that were considered like family.,5

Only thing consistent is change,"Company allows their associates to try new things to ensure they are in a role that fits their interests, but primarily skill sets to be successful.  In recent years there has been a lot of change in how we work, which is a driving force for the Company to move forward to achieve the best possible outcome for their share holders.",4
Great company,"I worked in store planning for the greatest retail expansion in us history and before that I was one of the youngest general managers in the company.I worked for Sam Walton the founder.......he was amazing and took care of his employees. Sam died Tuesday and I left Thursday, the world changed.No company used first names in business before Sam started it.Sam was a pilot and flew over the parking lot and counted cars.Some employees were millionaires before 30 years of age because of stock splits.",5
Walmart promotes advancement opportunities often,"Working for the biggest retail company in the world, you immediately learn the culture, and how they have become who they are.  Management is there to grow you to the next level.  They provide you with the tools and additional training in order for you to succeed.

Great company to work for,I have worked for Walmart 35years.  Started out as an hourly mechanic and have advanced as high a level as Sr. Manager.  I have gone back to college and obtained a Bachelor of Science in Organizational Management.  Now I  feel it is time to look for work at other companies.  Start a second career,4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Paid well,"Don't really enjoy it but pays well , location is overly crowded management leaves the associates in the dark about everything and are very inconsistent",1
The other Associates were nice most of management was terrible often hiding from doing work,An average day was often not good as management would play favorites with the morning crew allowing them to dump their work on the evening shift. I would only ask for assistance if certain managers were there as some would help but most would not.,1
Home Office was great!,I really loved working at the Corporate Headquarters for walmart. They treated their employees very well and had excellent 2 week training. They also have very good benefits as well.,4
I loved working there,Great co-workers and I was always happy there. They gave me a 15 minute break every 3 hours AND an hour lunch.   Add sd vying fyi chk floor tnt do cm . doc funding,5
Workplace as well as coworkers were very helpful and welcoming,"The work wasn't the easiest and the work team was understanding of that, they would help you and cooperate with whatever was easiest for you.

Too stressful,Working at walmart is too stressfull.  They put too much work on one person to be able to get every penny paid to them.  I only stay because of all the benefits they offer.,4
Great company,I loved working there. Should never have left. My goal is to return there. Lots of advancement opportunities. Flexible schedule. Great company over all.,5
Top of the retail food chain.,Extremely fast paced at salary management level. Wal-Mart is at least 5 years ahead of all other brick and mortar retailers. The good - extremely structured and everyone is given the resources to succeed. The bad - highly political environment where long term success is based upon who you align yourself with. Everyone will need to pull out a “lifeline” at some point to save yourself. Also Wal-Mart is so large that you are just another employee who is easily replaced.,4
Has fun in a fast paced environment,The culture in transportation is huge. The regional operations center strives to stay relevant in an environment of constant change.  Never a dull moment and it is a great jump to a Walmart career.,4
Good work place,"I did start like a freight processor at  Non-con then I moved to a different department at the same building.Doing same work as a freight processor, I did have a cross training at many departments .Than I move to a different department to Dotcom department ending as research Dotcom.And I do also am a forklift driver.",5

Leading the way in Retail,"Overall, good company to work for. The company is still strong and operates by it's core values. I have personally have meet some really good people their and have become friends outside of the four walls. As the future of retail changes, so does the jobs. Job security is not a ""thing"" at Walmart. Do expected to be impacted at some point in your career.",4
productive fun workplace,the work place was so productive and fun and also i get a lot of experience from there and also the management was so nice the team that i work were so nice .,5
No job security,"The job is fine.  Expectations are high but are reasonable.  Then, one day, your job will be eliminated and you will be laid off.  It happens to everyone.  It's just a matter of time until it happens to your job code.  Many years with the company and I was laid off on a conference call with dozens of other people.  Just like that.  I spent years waiting for it to happen and watching it happen to others.  That's an awful way to live, waiting for the hammer to drop, at no fault of your own, just based on one of the continual reorganizations.   I get that change is necessary to be competitive, but lack of loyalty to your associates that have great evaluations is shameful.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for Walmart.  I won't even shop there anymore.",5
Challenging,"Hours may vary often, can be rough for family life, Very Challenging job, good training, opportunities for advancement vary, and are rare, Pay is very poor for hourly store associates.",3
Productive Workplace,Walmart is a company focused on new ideas and changing the status quo. They encourage thinking outside of the box. The work can be rigorous but it is nice knowing you are making a difference.,5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
always the worry of a layoff,"they will give yo a bad review just to meet their layoff quota.  45 work week, it is NW AR so you don't have many options.  It all depends on your reporting structure.  For 10 years, the job was ok despite the low pay and long hours.  After a reorg, I got a terrible manager and was out the door less than 3 years later.",3
MY Review Summary,".I love working there, I have learned so many skills,I love working there, The job has taught me so many skills,the leadership that I received on a daily basis was exactly what I needed to Excel my career",5
Great place for advancement.,A typical day at Walmart was to make sure you focused on your work.  Took advantage of educational opportunities. Work as a team and be involved in creating new processes to improve overall job function.,5
Is a great place for a start,Lot of things to learn and the people there where great and open to learn new things.thw management was great. Scrum was a new practice so it took a while to grab it but every one on the team was great and ready to learn,4

Review,"Challenging, changing, diverse culture.Work with cross functional teams.Requires travel for individual and group projects.Team based with opportunity for individual growth.",3
No Title,"This was once a great company to work for, however, over the years, it has become more interested in making more money and cutting expenses, and less about the people who work hard to run it.  The hourly associates are the hardest working and lowest paid. The pay gaps are enormous, and more is expected of one working here and less pay is received.",1
Customer Satisfaction,Work was very fair. Management was very understanding and explained to me what needed to be done and let me go my way of completing my work in a decent and fair time frame. I enjoyed my everyday customers who came in to put a smile on my face and assisted them in any way they needed help with.  I was always determined to help the customer with their problems even when it was out of my reach and need farther assistance to help get what the customer needed.,4
Good job,It is definitely different than any job I've ever had. Its is hard work and production is a huge thing so is safety. It takes a lot of energy. You definitely have to be motivated and not mind repetitive work. It's the same thing everyday.,4
good,A typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job the opinion about the culture,4
Walmart has changed,"Walmart used to be a beacon of light in corporate America. However, in recent years, it has been necessary for the corporation to adopt the more aggressive nature typical of giant corporations. Do not expect to rest on your laurels! You MUST put forth effort to grow personally and professionally to survive. But, if you do, you will be generous rewarded!",4
Great company,Great company for young professionals to learn and grow. Multiple lower level roles to switch between to get cast experience.  The higher the role the more difficult to cross between different types of roles,4
Good wages for entry level work,"Easy work opportunities for people just entering the workforce. Walmart really watches it's hourly employees.  Reports are kicked out on everything: phone calls, breaks, time management, attendance, and goal achievement. On the plus side, a person can't get away with being a slacker, and the only way you won't be successful- is if you don't want to be. Walmart makes all the tools to be successful available to everyone.",5
The Culture has changed and the people with it,"Having over 17 years w/ WM this time I can see the changed in Mgmt and the change in the culture.  People don't like all the politics that are involved in doing your job these days.  You dedicate yourself, your life to a job and they can cut it from you in an instand.",2
Walmart taught me the skills needed for the positions that I had.,"Walmart hired me as a young single parent.   I had absolutely no working skills.   Walmart taught me the skills I needed for the positions I held.  I honed those skills, and was proud to be a part of such a great company!",5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Fast Paced and task complete is a demand,We offload trucks and store products in their designated storage and pins. We stock frozen and Dried Goods and also label products with shelf lives freshness Dates,5
Strong Culture with High Pressure,Strong culture of caring for the customer and having a productive work environment.  Comfortable working space with collaboration areas and ability to focus.  Management styles vary by leader and can be overbearing.,4
Good job,This is a good job depending on how well you can handle all the incoming calls. The managers and your co workers are always willing to help and they are willing to assist in bettering yourself.,4
Competitive and no stability,"Walmart is a very competitive company to get into. I started at the CC to get my foot in the door so I can eventually move into the department that best suites me and my degree. This, I was told would be easy. I find it is harder than I thought as anyone I would reach out to to networks didn't seem to want to take the time to speak with me.",3
"Great culture, great opportunity, great company",The company has great opportunities in almost any type of career you can imagine. The culture truly is focused on the customers and the associates (employees).,5
Liars and Cheaters Everywhere!,"Make yourself comfortable, because this is going to be a long review. I want everybody to know what working at a Walmart DC is like. I know it won't change anything, but if I can convince even a single person not to apply here, it'll be worth it. Over the past seven years I have worked in three different Walmart stores and two different places in the Walmart home office. While all of these jobs were pretty bad, I never had to put up with the amount of nonsense I've had to endure during my three months at the distribution center. First and foremost, the managers are liars. If they tell you a job is full time, they're lying. They will promise you forty hours a week, but you'll end up working thirty if you're lucky and twenty if you aren't. When they hire you they'll claim that they're in a ""slow period"" between seasons, which is when they like to bring in new associates for training. This is a lie. Business isn't slow, it's DEAD. And the ""slow season"" NEVER ENDS. They might get busy in October and April, but then it'll die again after three or four weeks. This means that you will be sent home anywhere from two to five hours early every single day. This is not a choice, you MUST clock out and go home. You can cover that time with PTO if you have any, but having to use it every day means you'll eat through it faster than you can earn it. So get used to teeny tiny paychecks. What's worse is that there is clearly still work to be done. There are machines and equipment to clean, small tasks like picking up stray items, moving boxes, etc. You could even go help out in another - more...",1

Productive SCRUM experience,"Bentonville is great. The team is extremely smart. Agile was immature, but had a team of strong scrum masters that supported the transition from waterfall.",5
Nice place to work,Good place to work. The pay is good. You can advance if you choose to. My work schedule is great. I like working on the weekends. It leaves me time to do what I want during the week,4
Good working experience in walmart account,Overall it is Good working experience and got knowledge in systems and ecommerce business very well. Working with various teams and systems gave me an idea of online order flow between systems thoroughly,3
Good company,Casual work environment but high tech programs and opportunity to learn new skills and advance.  Management could be a little stricter alot of wasted time by associates.  Good team events,4
Look elsewhere.,Used to be a great company 25 years ago. They sold me out to a 3 rd party. Not the same company. Very stressful toxic work environment. They don’t drug test anymore associates are weird they hire anyone now.,1
Walmart is a great place to work,I worked for Walmart/Sam’s for over 10 years and would love to have the opportunity to work there again. They really do make you feel like you’re a part of their family!,5
10+ year associate,After 10 awesome years at a company I admired the changes being noted in other areas crept into my department. As headcount cuts became a regular occurrence and benefits were cut the stress of wondering if we were next destroyed the productivity and morale of the department. In spite of all the wonderful experiences I had at Walmart I have come to believe that company is gone and the dog eat dog atmosphere of a company run for shareholders is not for me.,2
Very stressful job,I worked for Walmart inside and outside. Managers seemed to favor certain employees over others. I’d be working hard while we had lazy employees do nothing and managers did absolutely nothing about it.,2
Fun and collaborative team,Fun and collaborative team to work with. Good on sharing knowledge and helpful. Team is very friendly and easily approachable for any support   with work.,5
Don't waste your time,"If your looking for a place to be stuck in the same position with no way to move up, then you've found the right place. The management here is horrible and do not care if you excel. Pay increase is a joke.  Every year if you're lucky you might get a 10 cent raise. The only thing that is good about the job is the people you work with.",3
"Comfortable Atmosphere, Connected Culture","Work in ambiguous environment to identify cost saving in the domestic supply chain. Freedom to work with whatever tools you want, but challenged to find meaningful impacts.",4
Culture,They have lost their culture for the most part.  I'm hoping they can find a way to recapture it soon. The hardest part about working for Walmart is the being held responsible for things you have no control of.,3
Great place to work and are exposed to many different processes in the business,"Very fun work enviroment, learned about how meetings and reports were necessary and the importance to provide correct information. Friendly atmosphere, always felt we worked as a team.",5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
"Good coworkers, management could use some work",All of my coworkers were very friendly and helpful in my times of need. The managers did not communicate well with each other. One day I had 3 different managers come to me and asked completely different things of me.,3
Best work place,"Walmart is always training and keeping employees up to date with the new technology and business related issues. They take care of associates on and off work, the management exhibits excellent leadership.",5
Mejores años cuando trabaje en walmart,Trabajo me ayudo mucho en vida personal y me enseño practicas y en desempeñar mi habilidades con clientes y computacion,5
Stay away from any job in the Contact Center,"Atmosphere in the Contact Center is terrible.  Low morale, high turnover.  Extremely micromanaged.  I have been in the workforce for nearly 30 years and this is by far the worst environment I have ever worked in. Management constantly threatens employees with ""coachings"" and termination.  You are timed by how long you remain in the proper Aux code on your phone, and receive reprimands for being in the incorrect Aux longer than 5 minutes, regardless of the circumstances.  You are only allowed 5 minutes of personal time per 8 hour shift (bathroom trips, etc.) before it begins to affect your ""adherence,"" or the percentage of your scheduled shift you are in the correct Aux code, which must remain above 94% or coaching will result. Customer Service surveys also can result in coachings, but the low customer service score that is given can be the result of no fault of your own.  If you escalate a ticket to a higher level of management whi answers the ticket not to the customer's satisfaction, the low customer service score (CSAT) counts against you, regardless if you had anything to do with the answer or not. Overall, as a company Walmart is not bad to work for, and I have been trying to transfer for 2+ years.  But stay far, far away from the Contact Center.",4
I love to be a part of this organisation were we get to do things differently.,i have learned how to operate with the resource which is available and having interaction with the other teams help to make to know were we are aiming to be.,4
Good place to work,Will get opportunities to work on new technologies. A typical day at work include morning scrum meeting followed by technical discussions and then working on the user stories assigned.,4
Depending on where you work in the company depends on the stress level,"Little time for down time and/or some fun.Motto, work more with less.I liked every position that I worked in, but management was my least favorite.So many changes and update can make your head spin",4
Productive and busy environment,"Enjoyed working at Walmart for the most part. Enjoyed the other employees I worked with. Learned the difference in Identifications and drivers Licenses (which were fake and which were real).  Management wasn't very knowledgeable or helpful at most times. Walmart is not very employee friendly at times, however they never discriminated again the disabled and that was very nice to see. Hardest part was when customers wanted to speak with the manager and he ignored them and left the employees to handle all situations the best they could. The best part of working for the company was the different people that you got to interact with.",3
It,"Senior Dirctor>Dirctors>Senior manage>Managers>engineerSenior Dirctor>Dirctors>Senior manage>Managers>engineer Too many managers, and directors, too many changes. Too little pay. Working for Walmart ISD is perfect recipe to destroy you IT career. To many positions and too many butt kissers work at ISD.",1
Its the place to be!,Its the place to be. Always something to participate in. They have classes you can take to learn more skills in your area and others if interested. If your working long hours they feed you and they thank you for your extra time. Great group of leaders and peers.,5
Good job,"bad management is a virus that you can't get away from. Its the single largest driving factor for pushing out talent.  If more was done to hold leaders accountable for bad decisions, would recommend.",4
It Was a Job I Stayed Longer Than Intended,"I don't know much of what to say here, because I still work there. I don't hate it, but I certainly don't love it. Making $12.75 as an hourly supervisor and think that is way too low for a company as big as Walmart to pay their supervisors that do as much as they do. I don't even get to do the parts of the job I was hired to do most of the time, as we are so short staffed I'm asked to help in any random direction that is needed. I'd stay if pay was higher, because I like the people I work with, my specific management is solid, and I don't mind the work. But at my current pay, and what most people make there overall, I can't recommend it.",2
Unfair work compensation,Walmart is totally not a company that work there employees fairly. Worked for the company about 16 years. I was injured at work where a pallet fell on me and injured my cervical spine. It took me well over three years to fight to have surgery.,1
Working at Walmart,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart until I had to transfer back home because of family illness and my hours and days were cut. I enjoyed helping people at the service desk and also around the store.,4
Shady,Walmart has shady tactics and are very dishonest. Their network is connected with crime organizations and will enter your property illegally so if working here dont talk to anyone about anything and keep your ears open,1
"fun place to work, very fast paced, but good relations","Very competitive, very fast paced mostly, sometimes not enough time to get all your job done. Good pay for most positions and it increases by levels and bonuses.Management is good and fair mostly, some could use more tack.",5
"Great place to work, culture has changed from collaborative to competitive internally",There is a lot of flexibility in where work gets done. Strategy and goals change frequently so it’s difficult to keep teams on track. Resources and tools to do the job effectively are more limited than you’d expect for a company the size of Walmart.,5
Micromanaged,"Lack of communication; micromanaged down to the exact second you clock in, take your breaks and lunch and when you clock out. I lucked out with a fabulous manager. Most are not qualified to be a manager.",1
Date Processing and customer service,Helping all Walmart Associates understand their Health and Wellness Benefits. We assisted associates with open enrollment of benefits and also with qualified family status changes and data entry and customer service,3

Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Call Center is the worst,"The call center has extremely demanding goals set in place and VERY strict monitoring teams. When you are on a call they log in and watch your screen and ghost listen to your calls. Your “manager” has no control over your hours, your PTO, your schedule etc. They expect you to take abuse from customers and employees and expect you to not react like a human being when you’re being berated",1
Not a great place to work,I would not recommend my position to anyone. Management is very easy to work with. Very strict. Management plays favorites with hourly associates. I would never wish my position to anyone,1
Used to be a good place to work.,With all the changes to policy walmart is going down hill fast. Assocoates are just bodys taking up space. I was canned because of a lying drama queen teen ager.,1
Good place to work for,Good place to work if you have little to no specialized skills.  They do have good opportunities to move up but the are quickly becoming sparse to find and are thinking out.,4
The people there are the only reason I stayed that long.,The employees makes it a nice place to work but the management staff was sometimes difficult.Would recommend it as a last resort. Walmart has changed so much since 2004.,3
Company has lost its culture,"Morale is at an all-time low, job security is close to zero, positions and departments are being eliminated, but the work still has to get completed. Too many company processes that distract the associates from doing their jobs. Was a wonderful place to work at one time, but no one at the home office wants to hear from the field associates.",2
there are now game rooms put in place to confuse workers,"I have never worked for a place where being part of the the click makes all of the differnce. I have seen people get written up for a mistake were the company actually made money and another work make a mistake that costs the company over $8,000,000.00 and that per son got promoted, best friends with the director of the area. I once had a manager that was a Devil Worshiper who treated people more fairly than the management team that I worked under treated their people.",1
Culture is changing with the times,"Overall Walmart is a good company to work for but like any company, the manager makes the job. I have left the company and come back a couple times and as long as you had a good work record and left in good standing,  they are good to rehire.",3
Walmart Information Security,"I worked at Walmart for 5 years and learned a lot about their comprehensive information security program and it's top notch.  Before I left in 2017, they were a little week on providing necessary training and advancement opportunities for existing employees, but the culture and people were second to none.  I met my favorite boss in my entire career there and had several mentors, all of which were industry leading experts and fantastic, down to earth people.   Given the opportunity, I'd work there again in a heartbeat.",4
"Good place to work, but very Strict",A good place to work but point system is very strict. Not nearly enough paid days off for a normal year. Still very flexible with school hours and great as a part time job,4
Do not do it.,They will use and and abuse you. Work you to death. There is no life balance. They have favoritism for poor performers and reward based on meeting quotas.,1
Great place to work but don't go in as a temp,"Great place to work but if you go in as a temp most likely you are coming out at your due date. Big difference in treatment to temp/full time employees. other than that walmart pays well, has good benefits and work is set hours mostly.",5
Fortune One home office,"So many possibilities if you take control of your own career.  Great exposure to a true huge company experience. If you can't make it here, you're not paying attention.",4
Extreme place to work,"very high to extreme pace work environment.  This place runs on the life boat drill.  Top 10 percent get a raise, bottom 10% get fired, everybody in the middle gets to keep their job.  Good luck.",3
Walmart like many other companies is aggressively outsourcing many positions.,Walmart use to be a very good company to work for but as with many other company things change and not always for the better. I have had numerous positions with the company over a 25 year only to be notified that many of us are going to be replaced with a third party contractor.,2
"Fast pace, high expectations, very demanding.",Walmart was a great place to work for the majority of m career. The culture was changing but still better than most companies. Job security was getting to be a concern.,4
Overall day,Managed associates on a daily basis. Reviewed CCTV for preventative measures in controlling inventory levels according to company standards and guidelines.,4
Productive and Professional,Pending the position. Management could use improvement. I have used the opened door policy and it did nothing for me. Organization could be improved. I was hired onto a job stating my hours of availability but the management did not know which hours i would work until two weeks into the position.,4
Productive work environment with good work culture,"Working for Walmart is a very good experience. Very good work culture and friendly environment, take good care of employees.Fosters growth and productive work environment.",5
Best job ever,By far the best driving job ever they treat you like a person not like a number on a truck and they work with u in the best way they can and one plus thing is the uniforms look great,5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Transportation is a pretty secure career in Walmart.,Fast paced atmosphere especially during peak season.Great people to work for and work with. Technology is always being updated. Many opportunities with special projects throughout the job to help you shine if you want to participate.,5
Great Place,Had a great opportunity to grow with the largest retail company.  Started out as an Hourly and developed the skills to be a successful leader in IT for 26 years.,5
Fun workplace,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. Great benefits good hours all the people are nice love talking and dealing with customers. Management is okay not the best but not the worst,5
Management without people skills,Management generally lacks professionalism. There is no concern for work/life balance.  They demand more and more and more from their employees.  Can make a buck or two.,1
"Intellectually challenging, fast paced, friendly","Walmart Legal has lived up to Walmart's principles of respect, excellence & integrity. Recent leadership change & reorg has negatively shifted morale.",4
Hit or miss for software developers,"Entry level developers may or may not be placed on teams with technical needs aligning with developer skills. You may go in with Java experience but be placed on a team that does nothing but support and implement 3rd party software. As such, you may not be programming at all. You may only be updating configuration files and working as a go-between for Walmart's internal customers and support/development group for the 3rd party software. Make sure you know where you will be placed and if they don't know, that could be a red flag. Also, work-life balance can be pretty tough depending on the team you are assigned to. Regardless, all home office employees are required to work a minimum of 9 hours a day and usually your workload will keep you there longer.",2
Enjoyed most of my time with the company,I like the atmosphere the challenge and freedom.  I didn’t like the disregard for work life balance and quick decisions to release people based on lower managers feelings rather than facts.,4
Home office Contact center,"Assisted stores with all maintenance, fuel supply, refrigeration, eoc, and Scheduling. Busy environment, always opportunity to grow within the building. Issue is with promoting out is near impossible.",3
Loss of basic beliefs,Company is focused on hiring only vendor contracted works and removing associates that have extended experience within the Healthcare and compliance industry.,1
Great place to have varied experiences,"great place to have multiple career experiences within the same companycompany compensation is very generous but skewed to long term compensation and bonus",3
Fun company,Walmart if company to work for if you can handle the long working hours. I learned a lot when I was at Walmart IT department. They do take care of their employees.,4
Great training opportunities,We were given numerous opportunities to learn from internal and external sources.  There are several programs available to help with development and mentoring.,4
Great. Company,"Great company,  good benefits, getting more competitive to attract better talent every year. Nothing bad to say about the company or the people who work there. Great opportunity to learn retail and grow yourself personally and professionally",5
walmart,Great team of co-workers bad management. unset hours. work load too much for the hours they give you and the pay they give you. huge turn over of employees,3
Great company!,"I started with Walmart making $6.75 a hour.  If you get in and show your worth you possibilities are endless.  After 21 years with the company, personally it was time for me to shift directions in my career.",5
This position at Walmart was not bad but it did not fit my skills set.,My job responsibilities were not strongly suitable for my skill set and work experience. It was fast paced at times but slow at times as well depending on the work needed. Not a career I was interested in.,3
loved the company eventhough i was laid off,in 2007 due to the economy it was very rough. once all the old time leaders left (Glass and many others) the company went corporate and was never the same around 2005 or so.,4
Lots of work for little pay,"It's been a few years since I worked there so things may have changed since then. At the time I was there, the team was extremely understaffed. Too much work for too little money resulted in a lot of turnover.",3
Productive High Performance Culture,Walmart is a good company to work for.  You work long hours (typically 45-50 hours/wk) and sometimes more during peak sales times.  We are able to go to some personal appointments without using PTO and they are have flexible work schedules that should work for most people.,4
Management...whats that?,Walmart needs to let there managers do there job and stay out of the way. Half the time people calling the shots have no idea whats going on because they are too busy makeing the store look good and giving the idea that everything is amazing. When in reality its cause no one from the Home Office knowns what a store is really like.,2
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Loved my job with Walmart.,I tell people that Walmart raised me. I learned so much as a member of management there. I only left to  pursue a different career path. They were a great company to work for.,5
Overall not too bad. Good pay then or good work atmosphere. Not both.,"First time worked there, missed lot of time because of kid on the way, given choice to quit or get fired.  Second go around, had bad time keeping up with changes to schedule, fired.  Not very understanding for most part in regards to having to miss for family.",4
Greatest place i ever worked,"I started with Walmart in a newly built store. I was promoted to salary Manager before my 2nd year anniversary and worked my way up from there.  My higher positions included Co-Manager, Store Manager and then home office position.  I enjoyed everyday of working for such a great company that gives you back every bit if what you put in.  Please consider working for such a great company with endless opportunities.",5
Great,"Great place to work. Not leaving just looking for a part time job. Very happy and grateful. I take care of the hiring and training, also and development of associates",5
Great Company,"Great Culture, Leadership, great place and good company to work for. Company Cheer is the best part of any meetingGood Company values: Service to the Customer, Respect for the individual, Act with Integrity, Striving for Excellence",4
It can be a good place to work depending on where you work.,Walmart is always changing things and it's not about family like they said. If you find a good manager then it makes the job better.  Judge for yourself.,2
Walmart is Great,It is a great company just don't get too comfortable. Where I work the work load isn't too much you just have to make sure not to have too much fun. It all depends on who your manager is on whether or not you enjoy the job.,5
customer freindly work place and busy,the days were medium paced some  busy some slow and just really learned good customer service skills and management was ok but always on the go n busy to focus on some issues sometimes and the hardest part of job was when just when u had ur busy days in the store  and the best part of it really was the peope i worked with that just made the day better!,3
Productive workplace,"I learned many valued skills with my time at Wal-Mart, but restructuring of departments was not good for many employees.  There are layoffs almost every year as well.",3
Customer service driven,"Always learning and meeting great people. Sensational teams are working together to benefit the customer always. People who are driven to reach the numbers. Making the sales, being in-stock, maintains capacity, everyday low prices, whatever it takes to please the customer.Team work!!!",4
Wal mart,"its a good company. It has any type of job imaginable in Bentonville, AR location. I would still be there except for getting sick and my youngest getting sick with the flu and was pointed out.",5
Enormous potential ruined by their promotion system.,"The only way to get promoted at Walmart Corporate is to stand on the shoulders of the people below you.  There's a weird, cult-like mentality when a director get's promoted and the entire department goes crazy, not realizing that he got promoted by working them like crazy, cutting back hours, and basically riding the seas on the backs of people whom make 1/10th of what he makes.  Walmart is OBSESSED with the bottom line and they do so at the cost and expense of the families that have made the company successful.  I will never go back there.",3
Walmart Work Culture Changes,"Walmart is going very lean as opposed to Sam Walton's work culture of the past. It's more corporate, but I think it's for the better. Large institutional investor shareholders have a bigger voice which means reducing cost in all financial and logistical areas to include Associate Benefits. In all, I enjoyed working with Walmart and I would recommend Walmart to anyone trying to apply.",5
I enjoyed working here,"I was a district manager for Walmart for 12 years. It was a fast paced work environment that made the days pass quickly. I enjoyed my job and the interactions with the employees and the customers. However, after 12 years my position was eliminated and the only option I had was to take a demotion as there were no comparable positions available. At that point I decided to leave the company. This was also at a time that they had just changed the CEO and were implementing changes to take advantage of the employees and try to make more for the company.",4
"Stressful, Bad hours (different every day), split days off","Managers say they will work with you, just depends on who you are. No training to speak of. Got one hour to shadow on the register. I don't know what is the hardest part of the job, it's all hard, dealing with customers, management, and fellow employees. I learned that I don't want to work at Walmart again.",1
Fun place to work,Learn your job and perform it to the best of your ability. Always someone to help if needed. Room to grow within the company. Everyone friendly including management. Care about employees well being.,5
Walmart,I worked at Walmart for over 5 years. In those 5 years i never got a raise for work hard. The only time i would get a raise is because the company was being pressured into giving us a yearly raise.,3
Ability to change area's and roles,"One of the biggest assets WM has, is their people. They also are open to people moving to different area's of the company to broaden their skill sets.",4
Fastpaced-Stressful,"Typical corporate culture, alot of politics, plenty of room for growth and advancement. I would not go back to work for Walmart if at all possible. There is no work-life balance.",3
Layoff,Be careful with Walmart layoffs. It is like they pick names out of a hat. advancement is hard if you just do your job and do not get to know the correct people,3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Not treated with respect unless you are a brown nose,New managers treat you very badly unless you smile sweetly and buy them things. No advancement or raises unless you are their buddy and divulge all your personal info to them.,1
Worst decision you could make,"20+ years and every last one has been worse than the last.  Only reason being there so long is pay in the area is horrible compared to cost of living, and since working for Walmart have a hard time even getting interviews for jobs.",1
Good company but huge,Genuinely like the company and the caché of working at such an industry leader.  So large that you can quickly be lost and lose track. Additionally management is overall excellent but can be spotty.,4
Expansive enviroment for skill building.,Company works with associates to help them find the best fit for their career. With stores offering so much development in areas from food service to retail management.,4
unfriendly environment,unfriendly environment they can let you go for not reason even when your review in the past are good. the code of ethics are only in paper but they don't fallow policy. there is not direction from management and there is not training when roles change,2
No job security,"Walmart was a really good place to work in the past, but the company culture continues to change and they reorg every couple of months. There is no job security.",3
Great place to learn Retail,"Walmart has a phenomenal work culture that encourages constant learning and develops skills needed to succeed in Retail. The typical day at work starts off with a review of the business, followed by discussions on the key insights and any urgent follow ups. Once that is done, the rest of the day is spent going over strategic initiatives and follow-ups.",4
"Good place to work, good benefits","Good place to work.  Good benefits.  Good people, stressful.  I like the people  and working with the suppliers.  Good culture.   Learned a lot.  Everything is a firedrill which causes a lot of stress.",5
A great place for young people looking to grow their career.,A great place for young people looking to grow their career. Technical skills and experience with e-Commerce are highly valued. Opportunities to work across many business units.,5
Workplace Culture,"Culture has shifted from what Sam Walton created. The days of feeling like part of a family and desire to make Walmart a career are over. They have moved towards a forced bell curve ranking system when calibrating their associates. So even if you are ""knocking it out of the park"", if someone else is doing it a little better, you could end up getting a ""Development Needed"" eval, which means no pay increase and no bonus.",3
Fast Paced Production,Taking phone calls every 3 minutes and hour. Two 15 minute  breaks paid and one hour lunch unpaid. Very busy on the phone. Meeting phone time production goals. The most enjoyable is having cook outs. A typical day at the call center is logging onto the computer to clock in. Setting phones and computers up to get ready to take massive amount of phone calls per day. The average phone calls are 8 minutes long to an hour based on the need of call. Start times very from 7:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M and split shifts. Monday to Sunday.,3
"Out of 5 different jobs, I only enjoyed 1.","The rules were ridiculously strict in some areas. My manager thought that, even though I was unhappy with my job, that somehow I would see the benefits of working that same job if I stayed another year. I did not. I would have rather changed jobs, because I was unhappy with the one I had and unhappy with the environment and team I was working with. Not once was a serious meeting had to determine what would have made me happy.",3
heavy work load and out-of-touch management,"I had some decent managers during my time there and some not so good. Way too few people to do the (complex) job then doubled our work load by combining two jobs into one and people are overworked and stressed out.  My last leadership chain was brutal-did not feel they had my back.  Very poor reporting systems (and too many of them) that lack integrity and near zero training.  Some directors and higher care but they don’t want to ruffle any feathers because they’re all doing very well, so betterment is squashed.Also, shocked to find Good Old Boys Alive and Well in my department.  Women had much bigger workloads than most men and much better Work-Life balance.  Management told but haven’t fixed it.  Felt very unfair all the way around.There are some great things about the company but some departments are just not good and I got stuck in a not so good department.",3
Good company,"It is a good company to work for. Depending on which area you work in, depends on the day.  Room for advancement is good but again depends on area you work in.  Benefits are ok, other companies have better benefits.",4
good culture,"Culture is emphasized every day at Walmart; people at the home office are very nice, complete opposite to what people believe.Bentonville is a fun town but too small.",4
Fast paced environment. Adaptability skills needed. Met great people.,It was a fast paced environment and adaptability was a needed skill due to the ever changing environment. Worked with great people around me who were willing to help me grow.,4
Not a bad job if you don’t take on responsibility,"A lot of responsibility on you in every position. All of gossip and not much working, no holiday off . You will never have thanksgiving with your family.",3
changing,"good company if you have the ability to grow, becomes difficult as you get older to try and build your career if you don't have someone to help you along.",2
Walmart is not a family oriented business anymore.,"you are just a person there, they do not care about you as a person or a family member. They just want production out of you. They don't care about your your personal life at all.",1
Chaotic work environment with little direction and leadership,"The company direction changed greatly 5 - 10 years ago and it increasingly became chaotic.  Direction changed monthly, constant reorganizations, and projects that came and went with little support.  There is a lot of bureaucracy, and it is difficult to get things done because job roles are split and there is little cooperation to be found. Job security is a major concern as of the last several years.  They periodically sweep out those who have higher salaries, regardless of skill level or benefit to the company.  They bring in offshore workers and try to make it up with numbers.  It is a big place, so I never saw what most of the other teams were doing, but honestly I saw very little finished product ever coming out of any of the teams I worked with. I will say that compensation was very good, especially for the area.",3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Productive and fun work place,Our building recently put in games rooms on the first and third floor. It has been helpful to take time to go in and not think about work. There's always room for growth at Walmart.,5
A great place to work,"The work environment is very positive and they recognize your hard work. When you go in, your management greets you with a smile and a good morning. If they notice that you are down, they come and talk to you to make sure you're okay. They have 1x1 every month to talk about you numbers, where you can improve and they help you set goals. They don't want you to stay in the starter position, they want to help you grow in the company. My co works were very supportive, any questions I have they answered. There was no drama or conflict with coworker or managers.",5
Great  place to work,Walmart has been a great employer. I continue to have a great career. Walmart allows you to grow and experience many different areas of the company. You do not have to stay in one specific job type. You can go from Store Operations to supply chain and into technology. You decide based on skills you acquire and effort you put forth.,5
Relaxed and enjoyable workplace,"Management was nice, sometimes aloof but always supportive. Aside from low pay it was a good place to work. 6 month probation period for PTO and benefits.",4
Team culture with room for advancement.,"Expectations include mentorship of associates, communications with customers on project status and management of budget.Priority of job responsibilities with work life balance was the hardest to manage for both associates and management.Working with peers and associates to accomplish day to day activities can be fun and rewarding.",3
Great place to work,"I have worked for Walmart a total of 15 years and have loved every minute of it. I was able to work from home when needed, and my work schedule was flexible to allow time for me to take care of my mom when needed.",5
Interesting compnay,"i learned a great deal working with Walmart.  Many meetings and long hoursThe best part was learning the inner workings of the product development process",4
Just dont,Not a great place to work. Management was bad and you are never given enough hours to be able to support a family. If you want any kind of advancement yo have to be liked by them.,1
Was an enjoyable work environment,When I first started at Wal-Mart in 1998 it was a fun and family feel workplace. I enjoyed my job and working with the management teams. Things began to change after about 15 years and people were being let go due to their job was being discontinued. I was one of these persons. Another job was found for me with very little training. I was displaced due to the job and not receiving the correct training.,4
good company,"Good company to work for, will look for ways to cut employees though so dependant on position you could be facing cutbacks.  Will train and develop long term career skills",4
Your job is as good as your manager,"The ideal of the culture is solid, but changes over the last 5 years have led to pockets where incompetent managers wring their Associates out trying to keep up with the deliverables they aren't equipped to handle. Ask a lot of questions about the team and get a feel for the culture before accepting a job. But, find a great manager, you'll enjoy working here until they move them to a new position.",3
Not a very nice place to work,"I was a manager, the environment is not productive to running a smooth operation in my opinion. The lack of direction and motivation was surprising. The dis jointment of the staff was apparent. People didn't work well together and would try to under mind your authority if it didn't fall in line with their opinion.",2
Walmart a pretty good company to work for,"Walmart typical day is one filled with focused mission/goals you drive your day to your tasks and goal I learned to not only do my job and accomplish goals but to manage my career I really love the giving heart the Walmart culture has - plenty of opportunities to give time talents and treasure .",4
Excessive work pressure,"Not a great place to work.Project pressure is huge and the people to work with are not very great with new people.Coordinating with multiple countries makes it tougher to work.",2
Dynamic Workplace environment looking for Long-Term Contracts,"Advanced Career Development Lifecycle to progress the dynamic lifestyle of the culture, having progressive ideas as well as dynamism involved in doing work",5
Relaxed and fun.,This job can be very demanding at times and boring at others but fun all the time. There are team building activities and fundraisers for local charities.,4
Production line,"I liked working at this Distribution Center, because of my fellow employees. I was given a lot of training in every job I did. They did believe in working and home balance of their employees. Was a great place to work and only reason I left was an opportunity to go back to College and finish my degree.",5
Not the best standards,Company and executives have lot of promises they make and tend to under deliver due to budget restriction in every aspect. It definitely avoid this place to work if you are not in a corporate executive.,2
good,good place to work good place to work lots of learning good management and new tech to work with lot of new opportunities and nice place to live in good,4
former employee,The Walmart Call Center was a great place to work. The job takes great multitasking skills and a competitive attitude to advance. Most of the staff is very friendly and always helpful because they want you to represent their company to the highest of your ability.,5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
"Great company, getting in its own way, run on fear","Never underestimate Walmart.  It is a great company, despite itself.  I fully support Doug McMillon's vision and strategy.   However, it is sadly poorly implemented the further down the structure that you go.  Northwest Arkansas, home of Walmart is a tight labor pool and Walmart is the highest paying employer.  Some leaders use this as a tool to keep staff in check.   There had to be a change.  inertia had set in.  Many people were performing at less than optimal.  They had become comfortable and that hurts competitiveness and the imperative to change.  However, I believe that Walmarts approach to change has been wrong-minded.  More of a scorched earth policy than a retool and re-energize.",2
work load,"overwork, under-staff. non working management. bad moral from management team, no recognition, no tools to do the job. Can not depend on upper management. Always negative and no positive feedback what has been accomplished.",3
Productive work and friendly associates and management.,Associates are very friendly. Very productive work. Work space is a little small but is alright. Great benefits. Not climate controlled but can wear shorts in the summer.,4
"Good folks, bad experience",I did not learn anything. I did not the work place. I did not like the management style. I did not like the culture.. I did not like the compensation.,3
Good place to work.,"The overall culture of Walmart is great. The people are the driving force to the company's success. Work is challenging and you are provided with autonomy to do your job . Unfortunately, new management has been brought in and the original culture is slowly disappearing. It is turning into a competitive environment where people are concerned about whether they will have a job or not vs. the family environment that was originally there.",4
Great place to work.,Can be an excellent place to work. Great benefits and strong culture built around personal and professional advancement. Management structure is a bit convoluted and outdated.,5
great place to work,"It was a great place to work, i intend to go back next month its reliable and if you work with care you will have no problem with this job. Good pay and good opportunities.",5
Typical day,"The typical day included being forced to rush through calls to reduce wait times and instead give them a ticket to fix later. If the call was over 2 minutes or wasnt able to be fixed while taking another call you were expected to get to it later regardless of urgency. In theory thats fine until you realize that the calls and issues never stop for a team of less than 20 managing over 180,000 devices that all can have issues and there is never downtime to work on the tickets themselves.",3
learned a lot of skills with tools,Stayed in back mostly assembling items. Learned how to read lots of different directions as to assembly several different items.Management was lacking as I was left to do what I needed to.in the back room.Most enjoyable was learning the few new tasks,2
Started out as a fun place to work.,"Employment status was challenged frequently by Store Manager.Employees were somtimes retaliated against when they spoke out.Quality of life was not focused on enough.Policy changes caused a number of seasoned employees their jobs.",3
Friendly environment,"Always having events to make drivers feel appreciated. No matter were you go at Walmart, you are treated like family.  Very well maintained equipment.",5
Great place to work.,Walmart was a good company to work for. Was hired on a 1 year contract to install internet lines and fiber optic cables. They made sure I was happy with my work environment.,4
The work place was a friendly environment,Walmart is a good place to work at. I went from working in the stores to working at the home office before I left them to stay home with my two children.,5
"Funny,family, and friendly work place","The walmart culture is very strong in every part of the business. You need to be detail, honest hard working. It is okay if you have a good time at work. You will enjoy working with the people. It is really family friendly.",5
Fun and relaxing,"Fun and relaxing environment Very family oriented culture Competitive work force Great management  Company is always looking for ways to evolve and be more efficient",4
Most enjoyable part of the job,The most enjoyable part of the job was great crew members and the benefits and pay  and real nice customers sometimes and to get to meet and greet new people,4
good team work when needed,Come in to work to see how many labels each associate would have to do at the start up meeting.  Then would prep fork lift and proceed to get merchandise from the racks and place on modular until done with all labels.  Then clean up.,5
Very fast pace environment and so many opportunities!,"Wal-Mart is a a very fast pace environment and endless opportunities! You meet so many amazing people, and so many people willing to help you grow. Learning other skills is a major thing that happens in Wal-Mart. At times it can be tough, but in the end it's a great place to move up! I was required to train other employees, keep up with my departments numbers. Such as increasing/decreasing sales numbers. Making sure everything was in stock, accounted for, and figured out ways to improve and increase my department sales. The hardest part was finding a balance between running nearly four department, and keeping the customers/management happy. As you learn, grow, and meet other people to help you. Things become easier and you find yourself excelling!",4
Great work environment and people,Walmart was an amazing place to work; everything from the people to the overall feeling the company has. The really make you feel like you are apart of something important.,4
Depends,"I like this job then any other job, I got to meet new customer daily, sometimes you will come across from people out of state that have never heard or see Walmart to go. The manager is fun and easy going. Also is you don't really have to worry about your hour been cut unless the manager is approve and sometimes you will get overtime because the manager will ask you stay or come in early to fill in for someone. Only thing I don't like is that you want to get promote, you can't really go anywhere.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
What I learned,"Things Learned:Change will always comeAlways be adaptableConversation startersNetworking When I began at Walmart the Mission Statement was held to in great standards. As time passed the company no longer held true to their Mission Statement.",3
Not focused on what they should be.,They are way more focused on what their competition is doing than they are in just taking care of their customers and their associates / workers. They are so focused on replacing associates with computers and getting away from the human touch.,1
Fast paced stressful environment,Very challenging place to work for an extended period of time due to the amount of change with lack of tech and tools to support your business.  With the layoffs in recent years it has added a massive amount of workload to those who were good enough to survive.  Pay is under the current market with no outlook to be corrected.,3
Walmart,All in all Walmart is a great place to work for. The will promote within and they will help you with your career path. You can work remotely and have flex time.,5
Overworked,"A typical day within the Wal-Mart organization will last anywhere from 13-16 hours. There are several meetings during the day to make adjustments to changes (meeting or not meeting goals). There is little time for managers to have breaks, which result in them eating quickly or missing meals. The autonomy to make sound decisions is rare. Consequently, the managers often feel powerless. Often changes are made to managers’ schedules with little notice, which is difficult for single parents and those with young children. Wal-Mart does provide sufficient knowledge of logistics and the supply chain. What it does not provide is consistency. The framework is archaic; this includes software and some technology.  This structure leaves little time to develop positive relationships with employees. Often they feel overworked, silenced, and unmotivated to complete tasks to the best of their ability.",2
ok - was better,"Job used to be worth talking about.  Then they changed managers. Horrible one they just keep moving around.  Ruined team and degraded the job.  Some times you get lucky, others - not so much.",3
Good pay and comfortable work area .,Stay on the managers good side . support your coworkers and move quickly. Adapt to changes and follow directions to the best of your ability. Do not forget to frequently check you're schedule. And never forget to call in when you're sick. Relax mentally but dont slack or zone out.,5
Listen to the associates,Change--it can be good and usually is.  But... sometimes you need to listen to your associates that do the job.  After all they are the professionals and they know what their job entails and what they need to excel to be the best they can be.,3
For the young only,"Only the young and innocent promoted. They want to make you into a robot. Quotas are the pits. Just like factory workers. They don’t trust their associates. They want to micromanage. Great people are let go. Loyalty means nothing. Okay if you only have high school and are desperate Who’s number 1? The stockholders",1
Morale Low,Morale is at it's all time low - job security is a concern....many management changes - which results in directional changes for the area - constantly.,3
Over all a good company,You can't place your views on a company by the manager that you report to. Overall the company is a good company to work for. I learned to always treat my people with respect.,3
Great company for a career,"Amazing culture, opportunity to learn & grow, and work with lots of other driven, focused professionals. Incredible variety of career options across merchandising, marketing, operations, ecommerce, IT, supply chain, real estate, law, and many more.",5
Good place for beginners,"A good for beginners and it will be enjoyable. However, it is an ocean so be ready and always willing to learn new things that come along your way.  Thank You",5
Great place,"Constantly lift 5-60 pounds, production paced, management is fairly nice and supportive, hardest part is lifting boxes, easiest is lifting boxes, A great place for career advancement.",4
"Overall view, good","Loved working with associates and customers although sometimes the multitude of changes instigated by management was not, in my opinion, the wisest choices.",4
Declining Culture,"Walmarts culture has taken a plummet in the past 5 years. The instability of job security has become the key ""leaving"" point for many associates.  Many feel unappreciated and the Walmart family is no longer evident.",3
Trickle down effect from management to hourly worker,"I am looking for another position because of the fact they have so many issues from upper management to department managers to floor employees. No one communicates effectively and many things we do are redone several times wasting time and resources. I feel as if they do not listen to us on how things can be improved, but we are never heard.",3
Workplace Culture/Management,"Lacking in Walmart culture that is so profoundly spoken of. Lack of diversity and inclusion. No career advancement. Management needs classes on how to manage others. You do learn a lot of technical skills, retail skills, and how to be speak the retail language to apply it to other companies.",2
Great Company,"WalMart is a great company and has great values. The only recommendation that I would recommend is look into the area that you are getting involved in. The area I was in was extremely restricted regards to advancement. You are allowed to transfer to other areas, but there are times that management makes it extremely difficult.",4
Work style was very demanding,"I enjoyed my experience at Wal Mart Home office. I worked in the J Street building as a Vetting Specialist. Strict time in and time out as expected, but also required quick adaptation to ""the Wal Mart"" way.",5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Many management area are poor in vision,Management enforce employees working on none programming works. Many senior PA manage contractor and help many projects.  Many excellent coders left. Reason of forcing to take management classes.,4
Enjoyed most peers and employees.,Dm was a real B.   previous DM was a good person cared about customers and employees.  Learned a lot on how to run a business through Wal-Mart.  Lots of changes taking the joy out of work and decision making.,4
"Productive, customer focused, and fun","Walmart eCommerce was very productive based, but we had a lot fun and the management was always there to help and support their associates. We had multiple company events offering us time to relax and have fun while during the holiday times when it would be busy and we were working longer hours.",5
E commerce research analyst,"its a good job overall. However, once you are in the company is hard to escalate to higher positions. I overall enjoyed the experience of working with this company. I also like the ethics and values that the company shares",4
typical large company,"too much office politics, too much bs, too much micro managing, often petty managers, talking out of both sides of their mouths.   There are good people, but there is a lot of double talk",3
Walmart - The Bedrock of Bentonville,"Walmart recently transitioned most of its accounting functions to Genpact; thereby eliminating the majority of hourly HO employees. It is no longer the rock solid place to work, whether you are an hourly or salaried associate.",5
It has been over 12 years ago since I was employed at Walmart however it was a great company to work for.,"It has been over 12 years ago since I was employed at Walmart however it was a great company to work for at the time, although very demanding and fast paced.",5
Consultant at Walmart through Cognizant,"Consulted at Walmart on a Dotcom project to increase their content quality online. Worked with Merchants, Suppliers and CSPs to increase the quality scores and increase the number of items in the catalogs.",3
Great place to work and advance your career,Walmart is an excellent company.  You will get as much out of your career as you are willing to put in.  Hard work that yields great results will be rewarded.,4
Stressful,"I can say I worked for walmart for almost 3 years. The company is crude to floor-bound associates and even worse for unloaders like I was. Granted they demanded that they have things done in a reasonable time when I first started, gradually, they kept getting worse and worse. They honestly thought that a truck could be done within an hour. Though this was highly optimistic about getting things done. They went as far as to add more people to unload trucks which was harder on us unloaders because we couldn't move around as much, considering they demanded that they have us in fixed positions. I can see how that works for new employees but doesn't work with experienced workers. I perform better as a floater or someone who helps with who needs the most help or what needs to be unloaded faster. I'm just glad I got out of there before it got worse.",2
"Walmart used me up,without building me up, then abandoned me.","Great Corporation, heartless I.T. abuse of SMEs.I arrived on top of my field, current with every skill and technology worth mastering.  They required me to share everything I ever learned, ignored most of my best advice (because it wasn't what they wanted to hear), then blamed me and the technology vendors who sold us the software, for not achieving objectives that some mid-manager sold to upper management (based on expectations abstract from reality,and contrary to what the SME and vendors selling it, would ever endorse).  After years of this awful mismanagement, most of those managers have been laid-off, the vendor relationships are sour, and the experts hired to ""fix it"" (including myself) are laid-off, and replaced with inexpensive very agreeable visa-bearing warm bodies, at less than half the cost of the hardened veteran SMEs discarded.I still adore this company, for the tremendous good it does all over the world, but must warn I.T. people that my experience serving within Walmart Technology is not a rare exception, rather an example of what the majority of seasoned I.T. pros that refuse to compromise truth for false metrics.  Now I personally choose not to sulk, but will hustle to regain cutting edge relevance and market value lost in technical debt resulting from my term at Walmart.  If I return within I.T., it will be as an independent consultant, so that I can have some control over the metrics my product will be measured against, rather than the deceit middle-management uses to justify personal career advancement.If you choose to join, you have been warned.",1
All about buisness,When working in a travel position work/life balance in hard to maintain. The company does a pretty good job of helping with it. The overall culture is positive in all positions.,5
Excellent Opportunity,I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Walmart and hope to make it back someday. They have some great benefits and the management was fantastic in my area.,5
Compliance,"This area is fast paced to keep up with the ever changing retail environment. I was able to work on many different projects to support the healthcare business. I was able to grow as a project manager and as a compliance specialist. Time management was the hardest part of the job as we handled breaches and requests from our regulatory agencies. Our team handles over 5,600 HIPAA breaches a year as well as advising the business.",2
The company is solid,There are pros and cons.  Every department is different.  Some have amazing leadership some not so much.  Some areas have great moral others don't.  Some leaders are exceptional and others aren't.,3
Great place,DC 6094 was a good place to work. The money was great for the time I was there. The work is very hard but is not impossible to accomplish. If you're older I would not recommend working here.,5
Great place to work,"After 28 years with Walmart, there are obviously good days and bad days-but it was a great place to spend a career. I felt like my contribution mattered and i added value to the organization and its associates. I’m very thankful for the opportunities.",5
Great Place to work,Walmart is a terrific place to start a career or spend a career.  there is so much role diversity  that almost any career choice can be attained somewhere throughout the large company.,5
Support team,"Provided support and training to merchandise team, suppliers, overseas partners, and support teams on company’s applications and general merchandise questions.  Ensured timely and accurate creation of purchase orders in order to meet production.  Tracked merchandise from origin to destinations and reported on any exceptions potentially not hitting event date.",3
No advancement unless you were Latin,"management was prejudice and racist, no other comments need to be made, The duties were as expected but there were not enough people to complete the work in a efficient manner.",1
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
n/a,A typical day. I learn. Management. Work place . management. culture. good but hard . and enjoyable. management. I did not feel comfortable answering it.,3
Has diversity in career choices everything from cashier to legal,The company has career choices that span the complete spectrum from store retail to corporate level legal. You can go into almost any career as long as you have the drive and the education to back it up.,4
great place to work,"manage the day to day store operationshow to manage people and timegreat peoplevery good place to workday to day operationscoming to work every day",5
A changing company,"As a retailer, Walmart is evolving into a modern company that offers its customers great value and brand selection in the retail stores and online.  It's clear that the purpose is strong. As an employer, the culture of valuing its employees has shifted to be ambiguous at best, writing a history of downsizing and job elimination as the new norm.",3
Productive,I work in an environment where everything is driven around productivity with tight schedules. It's a very fast paced area with flexibility to the whole work life balance.,3
Great place to work,"I work for Walmart Home Office at the Contact Center and I love it here everyone is amazing and great managers and benefits. Health, vision and dental insurance at low cost401kstock optionsPTO Point system for absences",5
Walmart,"They are a company that thinks only about themselves. I was demoted and then let go on my day off. I called ethics several times, and they refused to do anything about it.",1
Excellent company with great opportunities.,"Excellent company with great development opportunities both in the USA and Internationally. Walmart provided training, development and P&L responsibilities that only a global company can.",5
Stressful!,Walmart has become a place of employment that I wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy. You have to constantly worry about losing your job or or being outsourced. While the pressure remains for you to work your butt off with little to no training. I loved working there up until 2017.,3
More relaxed,"It is very hard to promote no matter what kind of experience you have.  The dress code is more relaxed.  They do care about their employees, but they are fond of lots of changes.",4
Culture has Changed,Culture isnt what it used to be.  It is more about how much they can get out of people than doing what is right. Moving more digital and catering to millennial rather than their customer base.  I gained a lot of knowledge over 15 years but sad to see the original culture be damaged by new external hires of executives.,3
Fun place to work,The company is huge and is global which provides many opportunities for change within the company. They provide training and education opportunities for all associates.,5
Temp Job/ Manager was very helpful while there.  Fast paced.,I was only at Walmart for a short period at the Call Center.  My manager was very helpful and the employees there were very friendly.  The job itself was very repetitious.,4
employee,Corporate office is fast pace place to work.  Management could work on people skills but the benefits and pay is very good.  Corporation just need to learn to treat employees better,3
Organized Workpalce,"Routine job, but enjoyable. The people you work with really help you through your long shift. They're constantly catering or bringing in food or snacks to help those through a long shift.",5
Workinf for a major coorporation has a lot of challenges,"I appreciate the education and experience wal-mart gave me. But it was a hard job due to politics, compensation, and work life balance. Moving out of the company was a good move for me as I felt there was more important things to focus on then whether I was sitting in a chair with all my work completed",3
"Transformation in progress, Proceed with caution","There are lots of changes happening within Walmart, both good and bad.  If you don't enjoy changes occurring consistently, you should understand that up front.  Great company, great people, just the constant stress of not knowing day to day IF you have a job, what that job might be, and how much of a pay cut will it mean.",2
Love my specific job but am very unsure of future direction,"Thoroughly enjoy what I do an a day to day basis. However, leadership within the organization has been incredibly shaky and there is wide-spread morale decline and uncertainty about the future direction of our organization and company.",3
"Every changing, stressful work environment","A typical day at work is very stressful and strict. We are not allowed to stand up at our desk or talk to our co workers. We are expected to stare at our computer screens and answer calls all day, every day. Our schedules are on a set rotation so the hours change weekly. I enjoy my manager and co workers. I do not enjoy how we are treated in the building. We are not treated like working adults.",2
Walmart,Walmart is a company who’s leadership is at the forefront of what it takes to keep associates happy and engaged. However as it trickles through the ranks there’s a dilution of the strong ethics and guidelines the company prides itself on.,3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Walmart,"Not the best place to work at. Treated like children but also like you dont matter. No set hours you come when they want you there and that is it. Wants you there even in bad weather, People wrecked trying to come to work and were still fired for not being there.",1
Very nice place to work,"Good people, great experience. Plenty of adhoc requests during the day. The atmosphere has changed over the past couple of years, with all the layoffs, good people are afraid of losing their job. Other than that, the culture is great, there are a lot of very smart people working to make sure Walmart succeeds.",4
Eh,"Not the best, the manager micromanaged and made a hostile work environment. There was hardly ever anything to do, too much favoritism, not enough bathrooms, etc.",1
Na,N/A Expected to work more than 45 hours a week.Workload too heavy at times. No work life balance.Some of the directors were not good at managing people.,4
It started out well,"Sadly watched the company-wide morale decline significantly over the last 10 years. Great salary and compensation, but little work/life balance. No longer a viable long term employment option. Still really good people that work there, and have significant relationships that I will cary with me to any subsequent workplaces.",2
Not a place I would work again,Always remember that just because a policy is in place DOES NOT mean the company/management will follow it. Certain policies apply to certain people. Management will cover up what they have done wrong to protect themselves rather than follow the policies and procedures that the company has in place. Would not recommend others to work here.,1
Good Company to work for.,Walmart has helped me grow in my professional journey and I have enjoyed the 13 years I have been there. I like the support they give the community and this country in s time if need.,4
The contact center is a miserable workplace.,"Answer back to back phone calls all day, providing status updates and explanations why patients orders are running behind. Held to strict metrics, i.e. actions per hour, calls per day, adherence, quality and customer service survey. Work schedule changes every week and break schedule changes daily. Almost impossible to use PTO, most people end up taking an occurrence. Poor leadership, poor direction from leadership, unorganized and dysfunctional. The culture is not what they preach, and forget trying to network, job shadow, have introductory interviews or meet with your mentors on a regular basis.The restrooms at the contact center are some of the most disgusting restrooms I have ever been in.",2
"When I worked at Walmart for the first 19 years, it was wonderful.  The company was amazing.  This last few years have not been good at all.","I do not like my typical day at work.What I do like is to be able to love my job and work with people in my team or other teams - working for helping the customer.I like working with employees and helping them to further their career and helping them understand what they need to do differently. The hardest part of the job today is that people are being laid off or fired frequently - in many places (building), almost daily.",2
Hard work but in the end it pays off.,I love working at the warehouse because it was family oriented it had great benefits and great pay I wish I did not have to relocate because I lost a very good job.,5
CAM Manager II,"Analyze and manage a large territory auditing invoice claims, negotiating costs during desk top audits, while developing good working relationships with Landlord, maintenance companies, city officials.",3
Highly Demanding Workplace,"Learned a lot about retails management, retails operations, working with diverse people and professional backgrounds that helped me to better myself for the future.",4
Good place to rise the ranks for motivated individuals,"The work culture and opportunities differ significantly between each business unit (finance, marketing, etc.) so be sure to reach out to reviewers in your specific group to get an accurate impression. The 'every day low price/cost' mentality rules all at Walmart HQ, and second comes serving the customer and 'delighting' them. In some groups there is resistance to integrating with Walmart.com (in the Bay area) or other Walmart brands (Jet in Hoboken, Bonobos in NY, etc.), but other areas are very passionate and excited about going more digital and working with the newer branches of the company. Overall culture is very G-rated (no drinking, cursing, crude jokes, etc.). You can move between business units once you have proved yourself (typically 2 years between promotions or job changes). If you want to do it, Walmart has the role, so it's just a matter of finding your fit.",5
Management,Management at Walmart is very poor. People are promoted all the time that should not have ever been. Pay here at Walmart is does not even out with the cost of living here in NWA.,2
A great place to work,"As management I supervised the whole operation from personel to property management , sales ,merchandise presentation. Shipping,receiving and store standards. The hardest part was to maintain standards with a limited payroll budget at times. The most enjoyable part was to see people I hired advance in the company.",5
Na,"a typical day at work-funwhat you learned- a lotmanagement-fairworkplace culture-fairthe hardest part of the job-nothingthe most enjoyable part of the job-everything",5
Great company,Great company that gives a lot back to local communities and there workers. Good culture to work.  Large company with many options to move around in for work.,5
Wonderful Experienc,"Walmart is proud of it culture; and rightly should be; they have a culture of family within the work environment.  I appreciated the company, the people and the culture.  I would work for Walmart again if the opportunity arose.",5
Best Retailer To Work For,Organization really values training and improvement. Felt lucky to be able to learn from some of the best and do what I could to help people save money and live better,5

Senior Consultant/ Java Lead,"Work culture, Learning scope, Transparency, Employee benefits. I worked in this project for quite long time as contractor, where i enjoyed the environment and working process",5
Structured with Team/Family Encourgement,"Walmart tends to have it's own set of politics to maneuver, however it it has great people who care.  There are class development opportunities for personal growth.  A lot of Sam's ""beliefs"" are not followed as closely as they once were.  They expect high turn out with increasing workloads.  They are however highly flexible in work hours so long as the business needs are met.",3
Working for Walmart is demanding but the rewards are tangible because it is the people,"In working for Walmart there is a metric for everything.  It is easy dig in an find an answer to a problem for almost anything.  The challenge is not getting bogged down in the weeds and being able to remember the success of the company, its associates.  That is the true reward.  Watching each associate grow from being challenged.",4
Low Pay,Low Pay. A lot of stress and politics. You had no work life balance. You will need to work horrible hours. Pay could be better and know I believe these jobs are being outsourced.,2
Job is OK,"Working for Wa-Mart is ok. They do give you a discount card, which does help with buying things. Work life balance is ok. CEO is ok. IT jobs are mostly either being outsourced.",4
enjoyable,"Enjoyed working at WalmartSome supervisors were no as helpful in my advancement or goals as others were.  I am glad to see that mandatory Saturday morning meetings are not the same as they were when I was working there",4
"Walmart Was Good to Me, But Very Heavy Workload","I was a VP at Walmart (promoted into that position), and Walmart provided great compensation and benefits.  It was a big team for me to manage (went from managing 10 to 50), and the workload was too much.",3
Positioning for the future,"Everyone is doing the best they can, but the organization is so massive that it's hard to get everyone going in the same direction.  The result is a lot of work silos and competing directions all at once.",3
Professional and productive work place,During a typical day I will take between 50 and 70 calls. Management is very understanding of call handle times and will do their best to assist you. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the team outings we participate in.,5
Poor environment for minorities,"Wal-Mart's ""open door"" policy did not work for minority management members. Pay was exceptional but different standards for different stores. One of the most racist companies I have ever worked for.",1
Need to improve work life balance,Walmart shifted from being a grreat inclusive company about working together to a company driven by executing directives. I worked with some of the best leaders. There are a lot of great people in this company and they are leaving. You were inspired by a great meeting and then reality set in when you went back to your desk.,3
Productive Environment,"Oh Walmart. Walmart, Walmart, Walmart..... Give me a W.... Give me an A.... if you have EVER worked here you know how it goes and I would like it to just stop. Productivity you ask? Well.... some associates are productive, some are not. Very much like family in the sense that some are very productive talking behind your back while others are busy stabbing you in the back and you can maybe find that one person that works with you that has a soul. And then there's that one girl that just sits in her seat looking at videos drooling with a 103 degree fever. The best part of the job was they didn't mind if I licked the windows as long as I wore my helmet. Management was great as long as you stuck your nose as far as you could up their butt and wear that poo stain on your nose like a champ the rest of the business day. The dress code here is very laid back. Have you ever seen the ""People of Walmart"" videos? What they don't tell you is that it is their employees. And the smells. Oh, the glorious smells. The hardest part of the job was having to use the restroom around lunch..... if you need to you better hold it and pray the urge dissipates or grab a clothespin for your nose and your bottle of Lysol. Speaking of, some like to ""sanitize"" their desks and any area really, their armpits....random person walking by. Have you ever walked through a cloud of crisp linen Lysol and get automatically blinded by disinfectant? I have. So much fun. I really wish I hadn't left, someone should really check on that girl drooling.",4
"Good People, Mundane Tasks","Everybody at Walmart.com means well and is interested in your personal life. There is a sense of community and caring that is unique to the Walmart culture. The company does a great job of being an inclusive environment and provides means for you to get the most out of your time there. With that said, Walmart has a ton of bureaucracy that weighs you down in the same position for long periods of time without many opportunities for advancement. It comes with the job, but if you work hard and prove yourself an asset to the company, then there is plenty of room for growth.",4
Ever Changing company,Has taken care of me for many years but the ever changing way they do business seems to cater towards the younger generation. Understanding that Walmart is an ever evolving company and in order to progress it has to make difficult business decisions at times therefore affecting many existing associates both current and former,3
Great org but lacks leadership owing to petty politics,Walmart can really make it big in the retail world if only they get their business and tech strategy straight. The current saga after Jet.com acquisition is going on for the last 30 months and still the leadership doesnt have any clarity on how to run the show.,2
Stressful,My manager was very controlling and not very understanding. I enjoyed some of the people. The hours I worked were horrible. The chances of me ever going to a day shift was not going to happen and I needed to be able to see my children.,3
Work Review,"Work began around 7:00 AM. Meetings, calendars, phone calls, budgets, expenses. Greeted visitors, answered phones, planned department events. I loved my job. I was sad when it ended.",4
Walmart wasn’t the job for me,Walmart was not a job I liked in my history of jobs at all. People were rude and not flexible. The work was fine but the people were very rude and would gossip quite a bit,2
"Outdated Tech and processes, stuck in stone age",There are so many old school people who refuse to change and allow change and refuse to listen to any new ideas on how to do something. They would rather blame the associates for everything instead of their outdated unproductive processes.,3
Results driven,While calling on WM you learn how the largest company in the world operates. You receive the best support for your company and all the tools to be successful.,4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Challenging but collaborative workplace,"Lots of opportunity for growth if you're willing to pursue it.  Strong collaborative environment enhanced by technology that allows for online meetings to reduce travel time.  Tasks can sometimes become quite demanding, occasionally tipping the scales of work/life balance. Benefits are excellent.",4
A fast paced work environment where you make a lot of friends,I worked at Walmart for 6/7 months and only had to leave because of mental health issues. I made so many friends there and I enjoyed the fast paced work that I had to do. It was fun but I didn’t get paid as much as I would have liked,5
Walmart offers many opportunities,"The opportunities at Walmart are endless, as there are numerous departments in which to work.  The many recent layoffs are a slight concern, in regards, to job security.",5
Work environment has changed.,Work environment is no longer inclusive. Senior Management ignored industry trend and has become a headwind for the company. The culture has been turn on it's head.,2
Great employer with a diverse leadership,Great employer with diverse leadership. If you find a great mentor you can be successful and have an outstanding career. The associates are key to the success of this company.,4
Strict attendance policy,"Attendance policy is not parent friendly. Once you hit 9 points your termed. No warnings, no flexibility, management won't even try to work with you. Any emergencies are not excused even if Police are involved. Wrecks/traffic/weather are not excused. Medical emergencies such as broken bones with your children are not excused. They go through a difficult 3rd party for LOA if you or a family member is critically ill for more than 4 days. If they do not approve you Walmart doesn't excuse it. Management favors and is poorly supervised. You won't go anywhere in advancement if you aren't favored no matter your performance level and experience.",3
Great people to work with,"Prefer working for Walmart Corporate Home Office where the culture is strongest. Each department / area has it's good and bad points, just like any other company.",3
Walmart Technology,"The recent push on the technology front at Wal-mart is a great start for the company, but it still has a long way to go. The company as a whole needs to get out of the mindset of using legacy applications and infrastructure. They need to understand that in order to grow, money must be spent and trying to do things the cheapest way possible isn't going to lead to the kind of growth that they need.",4
Great job good managers,Walmart is constantly trying to improve ever aspect of its business. You have to be able to adapt. They work with you to create a good work life balance.,5
Depends,"Overall the company is good to work for. But, it depends on what department you work in. Depends on the level of your manager and if they are willing to grow you or not.",4
Continued Layoffs,"I love Walmart, but recent and continual layoffs are causing a great amount of stress.  I have worked for the company almost 18 years and now I am looking to find outside employment before I am displaced.   Walmart has an ethical environment and really does try to reduce costs to pass along to our customers",3
Not the company they used to be.,Walmart has changed the focus from a family retail company to forgetting how they got to where they are. The Walmart employee is expendable. Unrealistic work/life balance.,2
Worthwhile company with good benefits,"Worthwhile company with good benefitsBalanced workforceStock options and 401kMedical insurance available Nice fitness center available at a discounted rate",4
"A typical day was rush, rush, rush.  Always more work then one individual could complete in an 8 hour period.","I received education in Retail Link, excel, excel, PowerPoint and all their proprietary programs.  There was always more work than you could complete in an 8 hour day.  Management pushed their responsibilities off on the support staff but took credit for the work.",3
Wal-Mart Account,I just worked on the Wal-Mart account. I really worked for Americal and traveled to Wal-Mart. It was a interesting job and I enjoyed working on that account.,3
Great Company,You either love corporate world or you don't. Walmart is a wonderful company to work for. I recommend my friends and family to work at walmart all the time.,5
fun workplace,"the work itself can be stressful (rushing from location to location and keeping everything straight as you do it), but once you have been there for a bit everyone starts to treat you like family.",4
Changing culture,"Working at Walmart no longer offers any more stability than working for a vendor.  Compensation is pretty nice and heavily focused on performance.  Current turmoil exists in getting a clear vision from the top makes it hard to know if you are doing what is expected.  Current struggle of power between Bentonville and California is tiring and creating a lot of busy work that keeps you from focusing on goals and things that you will be evaluated on.  Because of this and because of the culture shift, work/life balancing is also fading.",3
Walmart Legal Department,"The Walmart Corporate Office is a great place to work, but don't count on being there long term.  Once you think you know what your team is set to accomplish, the team is eliminated due to company reorganization.",3
very professional atmosphere,"Very high paced, always work to be done. Very good management team, and fun place to work. You can stay at Walmart HO for a long period of time because there are so many jobs you can transfer into.",5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Nice,I enjoyed my job and the people that I worked for. Love the opportunities that were given to employees in corporate offices to further your education.,3
Productive,Great place to work. Not every team or leader is the same. I only wished there was more options to work from home for associates that do not come face to face with a customer.,5
Very structured large company,Small fish in a very big pond.  Education and experience often trumped by seniority and EEOC status.  A very political environment; very competitive and cut-throat.,1
Workplace is a little monotonous but a good group,"I work with a pretty good group of people. Personal opinions are not very openly shared for fear of persecution but as long as I keep to small talk, everything is fine. The work is monotonous but there is plenty to do and if I happen to run out of work, I can take advantage of the many courses offered for free through the company.",3
lots of sitting...,"The people I worked with were usually pretty friendly, some people just wanted to play around all day.  Sometimes you were set to meet impossible standards.  Other than that it was great.",4
Greatt Employees Alot of bad policies,I loved working with all the employees there some were back bitting employees doinganything to get a better job or a job they didnt have to work so hard for but most of the employees were hard workers.,4
Lots of opportunity,Walmart provides opportunity for those who seek it. There are so many different teams to work on and roles you can hold. Networking and building your relationships is an effective way to learn about new opportunities.,5
Collaborative workplace,"Collaborative WorkplaceGreat CultureLow on job security Fair comp and benefits Great work live balance Decent leadershipFlexible hoursCareer Opportunities",3
Depends on the location you work,"Each store operates differently. Being close to the home office makes it a stricter workplace with insane amount of drama. Management does not bother to remember your name and will make you work outside of your job title, especially with maintenance. Do not be afraid to transfer to another facility for your own personal gain.",3
Better than Average,The Company as a whole has a lot more positives going for it than the segments of groups/departments that seem to project and promote a cut-throat culture. Such activities and behavior should be identified and snuffed out - to ensure the long term success of the business.,4
Career Stagnate,"It's hard to describe a typical day for Walmart as all positions are different from hourly to salary. I've been lucky enough to hold both types of positions. With the ever changing environment that Walmart holds, you have to be adaptable and go with the change. One of the hardest things to do is accepting the constant change and the stress that comes along with it. I've enjoyed my time with Walmart; however, I've reached a point in my career in which I've become stagnate and there are not enough opportunities for me to continue my career in the field in which I am passionate and knowledgeable about. Thus, I am now having to resort to looking outside of the company for continue career growth and opportunities.",3
Great place to work,"Great enviroment, good pay and benifits, friendly staff, a lot of job options with room for growth, additional education, flexable hours and paid time off.",5
Store Design,Variety in making Auto Cad design for different store with different needs. Entry level management position so you have to have people skills to handle different personality types,4
The Inmates are running aslyum,"Worked there for 10 years and in the end it was very laxed. We had associates with over 15 absences but still kept their jobs. It was almost like we had to say pretty please come to work and do your job.I agree they should pay more and it return maybe they will get better workers and results.",1
I wouldnt recommend it,"It gets too personal there. Its hard not to get too invested in the time and stress there, it wasn't where I'm supposed to be. The people are awesome though :)",3
Wal-mart in the 90's,We felt like we lead the world in retail. This was before online retailing really took off. Our Information systems was lauded as a world leader. During recent visits it became clear that WMT ISD is decades behind now. A relic. Ossified.,3
My Opinion,Wal-Mart is a big company that is very successful. They work hard to improve every year with the help from their employees. I started almost 5 years ago. Every year there are layoffs. The amount of pay has stayed the same and the company keeps increasing the amount of sales every year. At the shareholders meeting they announced how well the company is doing. Another 1000 associates will soon be let go. A great company but a terrible company to work for.,3
Fun place to work with,First place of work where I was provided with point of sale learning and development skills. Provides all tools and equipment that help developers get to speed and understand more about the product.,5
Excellent place to work with wonderful people,I was able to get work done competently and quickly and was given constructive input by my piers and those above me as to better fit their needs. The work environment was great and allowed me to exit to get lunch or a snack or take breaks as needed or desired.,4
Very stressful working enviroment,I worked in a call center for 3 years. I loved my management and my team in my office but the job itself was very stressful. You had to be glued to your desk all day and the turn over rate was insane.,5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Great company,"Good work like balance and a lot of fun. The company offers a ton of family oriented activities, great for a developer with a family. This company offers a lot of horizontal and vertical moves.",4
To long ago,"I cant give an accurate rating. As I have not worked there in more than 10 years. What I do remember is a continued effort to be innovative, and a great culture.",4
A Day and A Life as a Walmart Manager,"Walmart was an amazing place to work for 20+ years ago, however, with change in leadership comes change in the people. The Management team is the worst that I have ever seen and really should be taken a look at and revamped. Walmart is bringing in MBA's to fill middle management positions and that's great except MBA's don't have the exeperience of the middle managers that get getting let go in the reorganization of the company. I hope they figure this out soon before they lose all of the good leaders.",1
Best place every,Best job every. Very fast paced and demanding. You will earn your paycheck. You will be called if you can preform and you will be rewarded for hard work and dedication.,5
Review from a Contractor (NOT an employee),"To be fair, I will clearly state that I was a contractor and not an employee on Walmart's payroll. I worked in the department adjacent to Sales, so I heard telephone conversations from our cubicle that caused me to have an unfavorable opinion about how they do business. The culture at Wal-Mart is extremely competitive. They demand exclusivity from those who would like to do business with them, insisting that they NOT sell to their competition. If that was not agreed upon, then Walmart would not agree to sell their product.",3
Great company to me for 20 years;  Insecurity with the future,Great company but a lot of layoffs the past few years and now mandatory performance evaluation curves in IT.  Feels like goal is to prevent future layoffs and associated costs.  Instead the new approach is to proactively fire associates through performance management initiatives yet these are curve/nbr based leaving some people vulnerable who are actually doing acceptable work..,4
Sr Project Manager,"A typical day for a Sr Project Manager is development and support. The atomy to be adaptable, very strong critical judgment and decision-making skills. Key competencies I've learned and developed:Drive change adoption on new development and processes, by leading change management understanding company initiatives and business needs. Ensure business continuity, by providing merchandising support thru best practices, consulting, troubleshooting, system Issues resolution, crisis management, training, etc.  Culture Champion, by being customer-centric, optimizes operating models across functional teams and instill change management.Excel in customer service by using professional and impeccable judgment.  Identifies and uses facts, information, and expertise to set priorities and make informed decisions.  Building and Developing Talent, by associate empowerment through merch model and ensure the organizational structure is optimized for efficiency and resources are aligned to maximize deliverables. The hardest part of the job is the politics understanding your customers and leadership ensuring all communication is clear and concise. The most enjoyable part of my job has been the ongoing development, ability to learn multiple systems, and networking process.",4
Great company to work for,Excellent company to work for.  Work environment vastly differs at the store level versus the corporate level.  Company culture is stronger at the store level,5
Great Company,"Usually long hoursCulture is typical corporateMore flexibility in workgreat benefitsHard in change managementGreat leadership - Not a great location compared to big cities",5
Poor management,"Walmart when I worked there had poor management, very high turnover rate, pay scale was horrible for what they expected you to do. Co workers were friendly",2
Stressful,"Depending on your level in the company, stress can take its toll. I was never asked to breach our ethics code, this is a big plus to me. With their PTO system, you chose your holidays!",4
Walmart is a great place to work and they listen to thier employees,A typical day at work is spent analyzing programs for problems or creating new code for programs.  Management was very supportive of any technical training needed.,5
Fast paced and competitive,"Great company, well rounded and provides many avenues for job choices. Need to streamline job placement for incoming and current workers to find the ideal job.",4
12 years,"After 12 years with the company, feel they need to focus on mid management, training on leadership, engagement and ensuring compensation plan is fair for those who have multiple units and markets to manage.",3
Culture Matters,"The culture at WM matters very much. But the culture does not adapt. Men are very much in charge. As a woman, I was able to advance, and it was supported, but I was constantly coached to not share my knowledge. Other women who were successful found innovative and adaptive ways to get their ideas across. It's an exhausting battle to keep up, but there are those that can and do succeed. As a culture, education and outside knowledge while verbally asked for, is professional suicide when you try to persuade others to think differently.",3
Profitable Business,Walmart makes over $50 billion per year so you would think that they would have a lot of job security but with Amazon taking market share they must stay nimble.,4
If you like helping people solve problems this is for you,A fast paced work environment with career advancement potential. If you like being on the phone and resolving conflict you might consider this oppertunity,3
Leadership Summary,"Most senior level leaders spend majority of their day in back to back meetings, most are non-productive with no agenda or meaningful outcome.  In the past three years, most of the leadership empowerment culture has been removed, resulting in delays and lack of value and appreciation for experience.  The company is transforming to a command and execution reform vs. one built on talent and expertise.",1
No room for promotion unless you are doing the job already.,"No room for promotion unless you are doing the job already.. They don't care much for you, just that the work gets done and aren't willing to hire enough people to cover the workload. Managers are mostly nice. Culture in other departments appears to be nice as well.",3
Fast paced  and focused culture,"Good benefits.  A typical day at work was full of meetings, going through lots of emails, phone calls, connecting with other departments to understand needs and direction. Outside connection to communities and businesses was also very important to my day. learned a lot about focus, commitment, listening, being creative, innovative, selling, being vision and mission driven, understanding supply chain and sourcing. finding savings. internal connection and helping others realize that we were on the same team with the goal of delivering savings, value and great customer service. making a difference in businesses and communities that we signed contracts with and that we served.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
2 out of 3 isn't bad,"I've been a Walmart associate a few times over the past 18 years now, and these last 2 times have probably been the worst experiences I have ever had. Lack of training, absent management, temp associates watching Netflix instead of working but nothing being done about it, as well as signing a 1 year contract and being able to be let go just whenever (last time was 2 weeks after start date after working 12 hour shifts over the Holidays) Not a company I want to be a part of anymore.",2
Walmart Logisitcs,Walmart laid off people with no reason and rehired people at a lower pay scale to offset budgets. The large layoffs affected all even with good performance evals. The right thing to do is let people who want to take a severance package and then move out the people with low evals.,2
My opinion,"Again, I find these questions offensive in some cases and invasive in others.I question the legality of your company asking them, regardless of any small print.",3
Changing Environment... but for the better or worse?,By making everyone uncomfortable with constant layoffs that have no basis on which people and why it causes people to leave on their own with no need for a severance package.,3
Mentor Program,I love that Walmart offers a mentor program. Associates are given the opportunity to pair up with an associate that works in a position of their dreams. They work one on one with you to help you get prepared for the future career that you want.,5
Walmart transitioning to a different way of working,Great people with positive attitudes.  Every profession available within the company. Never a dull moment.  Family environment.  Expanding markets internationally.  Global company.,3
Company Heading Downhill,Walmart has lost it's focus as a retailer.  Lately it has been buying up smaller ecommerce companies in an effort to compete with Amazon while also restructuring it's organization to pay for these acquisitions.  As a result there's been a huge talent drain within the organization through layoffs and associates leaving for other companies with more stability.  I would advice prospective job applicants to be cautious before accepting a position with Walmart.,2
Great Resume Builder,Great to have on your resume. They turn over 100% their replenishment teams every two years due to the work environment. Pay is not that competitive to industry standards and what suppliers in the area pay.,2
stressful but nice people,"It was my very first job so and i had to move to arkansas for it so its more me at fault for putting so much stress on myself, but the people were nice enough.",4
Great place,"WMT helped my career take off so well and I'm very thankful for everyone I met there.  You do move around a lot, but meet great people along the way.  I would do it again.",4
Great for entry level,"Walmart ISD is a great place to get experience in technology.  The cons outway the positives though.  Walmart is micromanaged and it's not how you work, it's who you know.  This has been the only company that you have to fight to keep your position.  They also give raises to people based on who they know, not if they are qualified.  There is favoritism based on who the managers like.  Sam Walton created a great company that has now become a cesspool of micromanagers who base your performance on if they like you. They will also break procedure and call you to fire you  The beliefs that Sam Walton founded Walmart on is no more.",1
Is a good company with a lot of good people.  Provided great experience and growth.,Walmart is a good company that provided some incredible  experiences for an individual to take advantage of.  It can be a little over-structured but you can feel comfortable speaking to executive leadership.,4
Great Opportunity,Love working from home allows for ability to work hours that i choose but desire more stability.  i miss working with a team.  i love the team dynamic and learning new skills.,5
Bad work environment,I worked almost 8 years at walmart and i never had any problem until the last month there when new CSM was hired and she was a total witch. She told lies about me to management . I was never treated so badly at work until she was hired. She makes it miserable for some select cashiers. Needless to say management took her side and i quit. Some of the managers and assistant managers i worked under were bad.,1
The atmosphere was second to none.,I really enjoyed how you can get the corporate lifestyle but a nice laid back productive atmosphere. I was thoroughly impressed with my experience over the course of the summer.,5
Sometimes boring,Some of the locations they put you in for security are boring and there is no one to talk to. They expect you to just sit there at times and not pass time with a phone or internet.,3
Unbalanced work life balance,"Many daily meetings, need to consider work life balance of  their associates. Unreliable for advancement  or longevity. Mangers are in need of management training.  Some manager's have no expierence in people management.",2
People are hard working and dedicated,I spent most of my adult life working there it was all I knew and now I am starting over looking for something fresh and new. Ready to hit the ground running.,4
Productive,"Walmart is a great place to learn new things and meet new people. Wonderful work industry. Culture is great, managers are able to cooperate with flexible work hours.",5
"great corporate experience, learning lesson","could be a rewarding experience under the right leadership.  It is a family atmosphere and caring individuals to work alongside, but business is business",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
"Good place to work. But, in something of a state of flux these days.","Working to modernize their work environment. Much progress made. Still some work to do. But, they recognize the need to be attractive to younger, innovative talent.",4
The best company I have ever worked,It the number 1 fortune among 500 companies.I worked in bentonville in Arkansas state which is the head quarter of Walmart proper work life balance I had found in the company.,5
Relaxing but fun.,It will never get boring if you associate with the right people. It’s a great environment to work at. There are some boring days but those are the days you would enjoy since it is so relaxing.,4
Great place to be,"While the pay was on the lower end, the opportunities at walmart for career advancement and learning were great.  I would go back to work for them if they made a good offer.",4
My experience,"Overall, I had a good experience. I enjoyed my co-workers. The work environment was nice. Everyone is nice and easy going for the  most part. It is definitely a job that one should be prepared for.",5
Favorites get treated better,"Top heavy managers. Micro-manageing constantly. Wrong - doers are not held accountable. No ""respect for the individual""  as said in their own training.",1
Demanding Job,Walmart is a very hard company to work for. Worked for this company for 15 years. Then Due to restructuring I was displaced from my Job without any prior warning.,3
Remember loyal associates,They need to remember the associates that helped build the company and look to retain them not displace them. All companies need new blood but they also to need to retain the older associates that are already trained and can help to train the new associates. When they do a structure change they are displacing the older associates for the newer associates.,3
Long term associate,I worked for Walmart for 25 years and was displaced by them in March 2018.  I held several position in my 25 year career.  I've had good managers and bad managers in my career.  I've supervised associates as an hourly supervisor.,3
Fast paced but rewarding.,Could be very stressful at times which brought down my overall score. The company was generally fair and always provided me with opportunities for advancement.,5
great place to work relaxed wnviorment,"Relaxed environment great benefits, They promote from within in the call center and the stores. They have a mentor program to help the associates along in their career. they encourage cross training the statement is for Walmart is you do not have to change companies to change carriers.",5
Decent temporary assignment,"Friendly people, brisk pace and workload evenly distributed throughout team.  Each team member responsible to accomplish daily goals set by team leader each morning.  Clear, concise instructions accompanied the intended outcome and expectation for each assigned task.",3
Great Company,"Very good benefits, Great Company to work for. I definitely learned a lot from this company and it has given me the knowledge I needed to move forward.",4
Walmart IT is an institute in itself. Have learnt maximum during my years with them.,"The best part about working for a such a great Company is that you can spread your knowledge on any areas by requesting your upline and working with teams engaged in different areas (Store, Claims, Procurement, Finance etc). Their IT Systems is very robust and being an Applications Administrator I got an opportunity to actually work with their Teradata and huge Servers hands on.",5
Does not care about associates,Walmart used to be all about their associates but now they are strictly business driven and will cut anywhere they need to including their employees. They are pushing out the old and bringing in new younger generation to help with technology curve.,3
"Good place to work, but no job security","I liked working for Walmart but over the last few years the job security level has dropped dramatically. I was just promoted to the position I last held with them in June, and a lot of money was spent to train us all, just to eliminate the position in January.",4
The culture has drastically changed,The culture has drastically changed and it is more like the corporate version of the Hunger Games. Loyalty is gone and it's clear that everyone is dispensable and a number on the wage line.,3
Love how much I can effect the industry by the Wm influence,"Walmart is a fast paced, where only the best survive. the politicking is crazy, but the work is amazing. you have to be at the top of your game to participate in anything.  the bad part is that it can be exhausting. mngt changes every 6 months, with different agendas and goals. that can be exhausting too.  the company goes so fast at such a huge massive pace, that most people don't last. if you stay on top of your work and strive to be the best, one can really effect huge change in the industry and market.  the power of Walmart is really intoxicating. it really does move mountains.",3
It is an interesting place to work,"It's a good place to work. Lot's of opportunity to learn new things, and room to transfer within the company. Yearly bonus as well as annual pay increase.",5
Love my job and the company,I have worked here over 10 years and have promoted 2 times have a whole bunch of knowledge do not think I get paid for what I do or what I can bring to the table have been applying for other jobs.  Walmart’s downfall is placing the correct associate in the right placement. Just because they have gone to school does not mean they have the knowledge of the company systems or business that someone that has been there 10 years does. And then has to train the said new person who just moved from another team and has no knowledge or skills for the new position.,4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
It is intended mainly for the East European and Asian markets.,"This model is the replacement for, and continues the tradition of the EOS 5000/88, marketed in January 1995 and the EOS 3000/88, marketed in March 1999, which were very popular because of their affordability, small size, light weight, ease of operation, and silent operation. It is intended mainly for the East European and Asian markets. With its low price and high performance, it is designed to be the “Next Generation Affordable AF SLR Standard”. The metallic silver finish gives it an elegant air, and multiple functions, including wide-area 3-point AF.",3
meh,I didn't mind working for the company but they had poor management and were not good at keeping up with employees and paperwork. I became very ill while working here and went on medical disability that should have kept me from losing my job but even still the manager over my department took me off the schedule and fired me.,2
ok,Walmart was ok to work for. They sent me through classes themselves. Their management was ok. They just tend to lay several people off every year. Doesn't seem stable to me.,3
good company,"its a good company. My husband still works there. It works with disabled people but it is Complaints mostly. Most things are good. I wish everyone got an hour break, but it usually only 30 minutes. Once you are off the clock you are off the clock. Everyone is super nice.",4
Regional Manager,"As an East coast and Midwest regional supervisor for store planning I oversaw existing store remodels pertaining to electronics, one hour photo, furniture, cash register check-outs, and 2 full store conversions. I was responsible for company assets in excess of $1.1 million a year. In addition I monitored and managed the SCM for the departments listed above. Extensive travel was a requirement for this position.",5
A company that has lost its way,"Walmart is struggling to meet the challenge from Amazon and discount retailer (Aldi, Dollar stores, etc.) and has so far failed to come up with an effective strategy.",2
not dependable,No job security. You never know when they are going to do layoffs. Management is not very supportive. The TL do not want to help. Some of them are great but most will not.,1
Walmart,A good place to grow with a good culture in place.  Work life balance at corporate offices is tough as you could be buried under a lot of projects to work with.,4
the daily challenges,"fast pace, follow up on inventory stocking from the night before, set the objectives for the day, follow up with cash office, personnel, invoicing, and upc offices to ensure that everything was in line, take action if needed.  proceed to stockrooms to ensure they were in order. Walk the salesfloor to ensure instock, merchandising, do some teaching and training with associates.",5
Productive,very good environment . Positive vibes all around . Friendly co-workers . Professional development. Cafeteria had the delicious snacks. There was a travel allowance .,5
Fast paced but exciting,"Company is great to work for.  Depending on project or changes to the company, long hours are not uncommon.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people that run segments of the business and witness their passion to do what is right for the customer.",5
Unfortunate culture,Culture does not promote the advancement or success of the individual and sacrifices employees for management gain. Not a place where the associate is considered a part of a team.,3
Productive and fun work environment,"Everyone in our department worked together to ensure the clubs received the best quality products and pricing possible, at the same time keeping our vendors happy.",5
Great place to work if your're salary,"Great place to work if you're salary. Pretty tough place to work if you're hourly. That pretty much sums up the experience in two short sentences. I would work there again, only as a salaried employee.",3
Great place to work,"I learned so much about the company and customer resolution. Promotion opportunities are abundant and they are eager to promote from within. Great benefits, supportive leadership.",5
walmart,well its Walmart its hectic and crazy its busy all the time so you have to be able to adapt and be fast. but you meet amazing people there and will love the work.,3
Great place to work,Has been a fantastic place to work for me. Has provided me with almost unlimited opportunities throughout my career. Has great corporate values and I'd highly recommend it.,5
Not Worth It,"Low pay, bad benefits, zero job security with people being laid off by the thousands every couple months, terrible micro managers, and cut throat job culture.",1
"Pay well, but you give your life to them","Long hours, like anywhere some very poor leaders.  Pay really well, but so large sometimes they dont really understand what talent they have.  Downsizing corporatly, which is good for the business and shareholders but process of selection is poor and more about who you know.",3
"Rewarding work, but keep other options open","Fast paced, interesting work.   Can be rewarding, but associates never feel comfortable in role due to constant threat of layoffs at home office.    Leadership is strong in some areas, not so strong in others.   Very important to be well connected throughout organization, as typical large company politics exist and are important for advancement and retention.",3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Bare Bones environment,"Everything is A-Ok as long as you fit into their plans. Once you don't, they will create an atmosphere that will eventually exit you from the company one way or another.",3
Over all a good place,Management is wonderful. Job security is not so good. You never know if your department is going to get laid off. They are not very mindful of the balance between work/home.,3
Productive and fun loving workplace.,"Nice to Work for Wal-mart, Confident colleagues, learning atmosphere, motivated managers, and higher management. Good cafeteria, big parking area, cost of living is very low compare to ther places.",5
Team Working,"Working in Emergency Management was very rewarding, we were able to assist our Associates as well as the public. Global investigation I enjoy working with teams to research data for their case.",4
Collaborative and Team oriented place to work,"Serving stores, merchants and customer in roles as Merchant, Operator and Support areas of the company.  Enjoyed working with various amount of people in various roles, backgrounds and experiences in keeping the customer at the center.",4
Great company to work for,I had an excellent executive manager who empowered me to drive positive changes within the company.  My boss was a great listener and was passionate about the team - great people leader.,5
A stressful work place,"A stressful workplace because of poor management...working with people who didn't know what they were doing,The customers were the best part of the job. Appreciative and thankful",3
bad management good people,"i have worked both in walmart store and in walmart warehouse. the store if you present yourself as a hard worker, management will expect that everyday period and breathe down your neck even go as far as to get you in trouble if you don't meet that expectation. where as of you don't work they have no expectation of you and generally leave you alone. on the flip side i have met some of the best people i have ever met working there. good place to rise in a company but not a place to stay if you don't want to be a manager. the warehouse on the other hand typically have grate management. all they expect is you to be professional and meet production standards which in some departments can be high but reachable.",2
Very high paced job but satisfying,Supervising employees to remodel a Walmart store. Traveling all over the east coast and mid west. Hardest part of the job is being away from your family 20 days at a time.,4
Work Place culture,"Great place to work, Enjoyed the time i was there. Made a lot of friends. Enjoyed the environment and the places and departments that I worked in. Good job",3
Overall a good place to work,"The culture at Walmart is phenomenal.  When they say Respect for the Individual is a core value they mean it.   Agreement is usually reached through consensus instead of directives. The job security has been a little shaky the past three years.  There seems to be a purge at the end of every fiscal year and if you're sitting in the wrong seat you may be impacted through no fault of your own.",4
underpaid,i worked as a sales associate and always felt expendable. Walmart has changed so much since i first started. The company is a shell of it's former self.,1
Walmart,Certain jobs have great training and others are extremely lacking.  I for one feel that you can learn anything if given the right training and tools to do your job.,4
jt was ok,work was hard and pay was ok. short hours and treated as though you are replaceable. my manager was good but many of them are not. i wouldnt recomend it to many perople,2
"Great job, with a purpose.","So many opportunities, working for a great manager and being empowered to do something was a career forging experience. The strong culture, and philosophy of making the customers' lives better made working a Walmart feel like a mission.",4
Interesting work but good department leadership is key,"Work is interesting, and days are never boring.  Department leadership has too much power to determine individual raises and bonuses.  If you get a leader who only wants ""yes"" men and you speak up for your team, you will be shown the door.",3
Fun place to work at,Walmart has been an amazing place to work at. You get tossed right into the job but you are not going to flounder. Senior programmers are able to assist and provide you a solid understanding.,4
Struggling Identity,"Walmart continues to look for an identity in it's pursuit to stay relevant.  With all the changes (lay-off's & constant re-org), lack of clear vision, producing quality work is a challenge.",2
Strong Core Values,"Good work environment for health and safetyLots of opportunity for exercising initiativeDiversity encouraged and provides opportunities for networking",3
Management was more concerned about management.,"Software programs were constantly replaced with the concerns of management being given priority over assisting users to save time and ease of use.Technicians were constantly having to take calls and up to five chats at once so the users were constantly having to wait for a response.",2
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
"do more with less, terrible management, favoritisim","Over-tasked with no room for advancement, management does not proactively assist in your career advancement. Very deficient and inexperienced management in place.",2
god role,"Did fainancial mgmt and accountingbudgetting and forecasting.Very flexible, and not to demanding.  Like the location, we love living in Bentonville.",4
Just an average job,"If you enjoy a quick paced job overnight then you may enjoy this job. I worked in the fridge and freezer mostly, but after all is said and done I worked every department before due to people not showing up for work of course. If there was an issue usually the managers could help, but that's if you can find them and they wanted to help. Walmart pays good for what you do, but by no means is it a ""fun job"" for overnights.",3
Strive for Excellence,I always do my best when making decisions that effect our stores and the service contractors. I am able to visit with my contractors on expectations and guidelines.,5
Its okay,"No different than Sears, Target, Kmart, or any other retail.  Wal-Mart does offer the ability to try different jobs, meet different people, and allow you to move around the country or world if you so desire.",3
Management,"Management at Walmart is pressured to evaluate on cut throat curve and it if you are not on the right side of their thinking, you will be in the cross hairs and let go.",3
Provided training to increase skill sets,Fast paced environment.  Many meetings scheduled throughout course of day.  Multiple levels of management with decision rights which slowed down development process.,4
Stressful,"Answering calls, documentating the call and saving it. Stressful at times and play favorites at times. Always in trouble for something if u dont meet ur goals or stay above 85%",3
Great experience be prepared for long hours.,At Walmart the hours are long and demanding.  It's a great place to learn retail but be prepared to work hard long hours.  Great place to establish experience.,3
nothing to say,"I do not wish to write a review of this company, due to the recent cut backs at corporate and the myriad of store closings, it would not be a good thing for me to give a review of this company at this time.",3
Amazing place to work,I worked at the Walmart warehouse and I absolutely loved it! I was a freight hand and we had a few hours of our shift where it was super busy but other times it was slow. My coworkers were fantastic. If I had any trouble they helped me through it and we always helped one another. My manger and HR were amazing and understanding!,5
Distribution & Receiving,I work in the #1 distribution center for Walmart.  I am responsible for moving receiving freight to shipping lanes or to stock inventory. I am also a safety team member and maintain production guidelines above average..,5
average job,I went through 3 mangers in 6 months. Communication was terrible. Hours changed weekly and breaks and lunches daily. Adherence was a joke. Pay was too low for the area. I do not plan to return unless necessary. Insurance too expensive as was the food in the café. Management not engaged.,2
Walmart Reality,On the real estate team you will be challenged to strive for excellence and innovate ways to save money to live better. Networking is a very important part of Walmart and it is paramount to continuously grow your internal and external network. As the biggest company in the world you can have lots of opportunities at your finger tips but may have a hard time reaching them if you are not the perfect candidate .,4
Enjoyed,Only left due to a reduction of work force.  Would go back in the future.  As long as you are able to adapt to change you would be a great fit.  Management doesn't always follow the guidelines set forth by corporate.,4
Fast pace work environment,Good work place to work to learn the retail business. Would not recommend staying more than 4-5 yrs. Limited opportunity for career advancement. Workplace culture is competitive.,3
A place where you can learn great customer experience make friends with your co-workers at the same time.,I had a great experience working at the walmart corporate call center. It taught me to be quick witted and always have a solution for the customer. I learned a great deal about how to handle customers who are very stressed and need an answer right away.,4
Great place but no consistency in my job role,"Work is fast paced, stressful and competitive but financial and non-financial rewards were fair.  Over the last  5 years there has been no consistency or security in the project/program management job family.",4
Always looking over your shoulder,Management does not trust its associates.  Work in Bentonville is not valued due to recent purchase of .com companies.  Lost all original culture.  New forced bell curve of 80/20 causes mistrust and favoritism.,1
Productive,"A fast paced productive work place.  It is a great place to excel and learn the areas of business management. Management is ever changing with the needs of the business. The hardest Part about my position was, getting projects out on time, when you are missing pieces needed to complete the project.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
A great place to work for anyone,Walmart is a great place to work. Never fails to give opportunities to people than deserve the Job opportunity. Walmart has been there for me through all my personal struggles and has helped them.!,5
day to day,If you like an ever changing job and the unknown if your job will be there tomorrow this is the company that Walmart is now. its long hours and a area that has its ups and downs.  people you work with are like family and its heartbreaking going through a reorg and losing those team member's.  there use to be security now there is not.,3
Good company with poor management,Many managers are risk averse and do not have technical expertise for the decisions needed to compete with Amazon and become a technology company which is the current focus of the company.,3
Stressful and in the middle of culture change,Stressful and in the middle of culture change. More management than workers. Deciding whether to be an e-commerce company or a retail company. Can be a good starter position,1
Fun workplace,Other co-associates are cooperative and willing to help each other. Management are provided valuable advice and guidance. Proper basic believe and good cultural are fully present at work environment.,4
Walmart warehouse,I worked here for the last 12 yrs. And yes at times was stressful and fast passed but it was a good job. I liked all of my managers and human resource clerks.,5
Great place to get experience.,"The best thing about Walmart NOC is that you get experience in Cisco networking Cisco/switches, Cisco and Motorola.  Down fall, directive is never direct and changes daily, no path for a career path.  Level 3 NOC has always hired outside and only twice in the the two years I've been with Walmart hired within the company.  Other than that, it is high paced and a good starting point for anyone looking for an entry level position for experience in networking.",2
Many Growth Opportunities,"Typical Day - Long Hours. Learned - Many skills in various industries and sales divisions, retail layout and transition, relationship Management for cross sector community and governmental strategic partnerships. Good culture in Corporate Office.  Opportunity to develop culture in standalone facility management.  Hardest part of job: retail demands.",4
Temp for Temp Agency Walmart had hired,"Still can't believe the behavior. Multiple Imaged laptops in various states of repair were replaced only to have them restored and replaced the same night. Was kindly informed that Walmart could fire me ( even though I didn't work directly for them ), and was ready to do any technical task required.",2
"Fast-paced, competitive environment, great mobility vertically and horizontally, good and bad supervisors (like any company), great culture","There are a lot of opportunities to interact with levels throughout the company (SVP, EVP, C-Level, even the CEO). Some of the hardest work I have done involves influencing the director/VP/SVP level, but the most rewarding part of the job is seeing your work come to life in over 4,000 stores across the nation.",5
Great people to work with.,I enjoyed the job position and the people I worked with. It was scary with the amount of layoffs over the past couple of years. You never knew if the next person out the door would be you.,3
recommended,Walmart was a great place to work with department and inter-department colloboration. Management was also colloborative and Walmart has a great culture. Would work there again.,5
Not happy,"I dislike the fact that you can get laid off at anytime regardless of performance. It's understandable Walmart needs to keep up with their competitors, but there internal approach with employees is just ruthless. It is very boring and you are expected to do more with less. Check out the layoffs website under Walmart. You'll see how most employees feel.",1
A typical day at work would consist of both strategic and tactical events.,The hardest part of the job is not knowing sometimes what the day would bring and being able to meet deadlines. In that process you also never had a dull moment.,4
Good company to work for,"I spent a long time working for walmart, but granted i live in Bentonville so that's the main thing to do around here. It's a good place to work, but just make sure you have good attendance",5
Largest corporation in the world.,Wal-Mart is the largest corporation in the world.  Associates are very competitive.  You have to be able to multitask in order to succeed in this environment.,3
eCommerce,Hard work trying to prevent the company from losing money. Have to be laser focus and pay attention to trends that exist in fraud. Loved the management and the atmosphere!,5
Many opportunities,Many opportunities available at Walmart if you take advantage of them. A constant changing environment so you always need to be on your toes at all times.,3
Great place to work!,Walmart was a great place to be! Culture is amazing!I would highly recommend the Home Office to anyone who wants a challenging career. Best decision I ever made was coming to the Home Office.,5
Depends on the area,"The company is so large that it depends on where you work and with whom.  When I first started with the company, I could not see myself working anywhere else.  As I have had the opportunity to learn and grow in different areas I was able to see several aspects of the company.  A job is typically what you make of it and Walmart is no different.",3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Productive and Fun. Family oriented,"The typical day in my particular position and consisted of setting travel schedules, sending and responding to emails, writing reports, meeting with the regional team, and visiting stores to evaluate store operations. I was a support person that offered my insights concerning training, safety, asset protections, and adherence to company protocols, process, and procedures. I learned a vast array of support functions ranging from interviewing to food safety. The management teams were talented, diverse in skills and back-grounds, high functioning, friendly, and knowledgeable. I enjoyed the creative ever changing work space. The work environment was family oriented which allowed the employees to develop a sense of pride and ownership. Because, I enjoy learning, traveling, protecting assets, training, and conducting audits and performing research, and resolving work place issues and helping to improve day to day performance I did not experience a down-side to job. The most difficult part of the job was having to terminate someone for a safety violation or integrity issue, but it was also rewarding, because ultimately share holder profits were being protected. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the leadership team on all levels and making sure our employees excelled and our customers were satisfied and safe whenever they entered a store.",5
A nice company to work for,Walmart is a nice company to work for.  It is in the middle of a major transition from a regular company to an internet giant.  They are struggling to reach their goal but I believe they will get there in the next 5 years.,3
"Ok company, at mercy of manager",Work life balance is great. Never felt stressed or the need to work long hours. Most people I worked with were pretty incompetent. The IT department was notorious for being extremely slow and not getting things right. Your job satisfaction was probably largely dependent on your direct supervisor. Some are good and some are bad.,3
wonderful company,"1. enjoyable but stressful 2. how to be highly multitasking 3. management was up and down depending on who you worked for4.the culture is very strong and enjoyable5. balancing tasks6. team building events",5
Transforming work environment with high expectations,"For decades, Walmart was a ""safe"" environment to work as it coasted along as the world's largest retailer. However, under new leadership and with new competition from Amazon/Kroger, etc., it's slowly reinventing itself to be more than just a steady employer. The Home Office is going through reorganizations that have impacted thousands of associates in recent years, which does lower the job security; however, through an objective lens, the reorganizations make sense, as Walmart pivots itself for the future, which gives remaining associates massive potential for the future.",4
Daily life at Walmart,Normally you get to work and you log into your computer and get everything ready for the day. Then you take your first phone call. Normally it is super busy with back to back calls and other times it is slow with 10-45 minutes between calls. If you like to work somewhere where you get yelled at all day long and can keep a professional demeanor about it. This is the place for you.,3
Bad corporate culture,Would not recommend working for Walmart.  Bentonville is not a city for worldly traveled individuals.  Walmart is not an open culture and does not accept people with differing backgrounds.,1
Never sure when your day might be up,People who have worked for years regardless of how much they know could one day have their position terminated.  I'm not too sure how people can feel motivated if their peers get terminated.,3
Productive environment,"Start up culture. Need to be self motivated to advance in your career.Need to be accountable and customer oriented. Innovation is encouraged.Vast tech stack.",3
The people are great!,Really enjoyed the teams I worked on.  Everyone was great!  I have made a lot of work friends in my career time at walmart.  One of my favorite part about working at walmart is how everyone is like family.,4
Culture was very different,"I love working with others, however it seemed coming from the outside it was hard to be accepted by the internal employees. The ten foot rule was never used amongst employees. Management was very unprofessional at times. A lot of name calling in front of peers and bullying amongst peers. I felt like the training was inadequate and managers could be very bias toward new members joining the team. Internal Managers need Business Management Training or schooling in order to successfully lead others. I recommend writing down every discrepancy or disrespect from associates. document everything if you are an external hire.",2
Fast paced ever changing,The company is ever changing to meet the needs to the customers.  Fast paced work flows to ensure the needs are met.  The leadership cares and wants the best for the company.,5
Good to work here,Good to work here    peaceful environment. Career advancement. Learned many new things regarding work environment at walmart.Very huge organization with good facilities.,4
Save Money Live Better,"Save Money Live Better isn't just a slogan it is in our DNARespect for the IndividualService to the CustomerStrive for ExcellenceActing with Integrity",5
Great pay and decent benefits,"The pay at Walmart is very good. The overall culture is pretty good, but starting to fade a bit, as older, more veteran associates are being replaced. There is a shift to youth and more of a ""Dot Com"" culture/",4
Good Company,Great Company!! I have been with this company for a long time!!  I am wanting to move forward with a company that will enhance my expreience to the level the company needs.,4
Great company to work for,"They still care about their associates despite their size. The culture is amazing but sometimes difficult for newbies to adjust to. The benefits are amazing including 10% discounts in stores and online discounts from phone plans, gym memberships and theme park tickets.",4
great place to work,"Typical day includes conference calls, meetings and email.  Many projects are moving at the same time.  The hardest part of the job is including all the cross functional people to ensure transparency across all areas. The most enjoyable part is visiting the stores and teaching and training the associates",3
Calm and productive,Very friendly work environment with a calm and collected sense of teamwork. The management is well trained and always willing to help in any way. A great entry into retail work.,5
Nice place to work with,"Great work environment and super supportive co worker.Helping members, my coworkers. Flexibility, good people wanting to do their best. Lots of opportunities to advance",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Great Company with a great culture,I worked at the home office for five years in the late 1990's when Walmart still had many of the original leaders that made the company great.  It is a huge company but is a great place to learn how the retail business works.  I enjoyed the culture and team atmosphere and understand that the culture is not what it used to be.  I'm not sure about that.  Great company to make your career or to leverage your Walmart experience to boost your career opportunities outside of Walmart.,4
Supply Chain Management,"By carefully managing its suppliers and distribution practices, Walmart enables itself to reduce its costs and offer customers lower prices than any other retailer.  Much of this success is credited to its supply chain.",5
Truck unloader,"Typical day of work would consist of unloading pallets from trucks, and organizing them. Long hours, with a 30 min break. Extreme ambition is expected from you to keep numbers up.",5
Fun place to work,"Walmart was a fun, fast paced place to work. I really enjoyed it but due to conflict with scheduling I had to leave. I have considered going back but I don't think I am rehire able.",5
Ever-changing place,"Good company to work for. Moving in the right direction in the eCommerce and retail space. The workplace culture is excellent because it tries to adhere to the founder's values.On the other hand, management is inexperienced and provide little guidance and directions in an everchanging environment.",4
A place to develop and grow,A tremendous amount of professional growth has been obtained here. There are always new challenges.  It is a fast pace and ever changing environment .,5
the company had a big turn over rate of emplyees,The work was alright the manger yelled at people all the time. very little training the hardest part of the job was putting up with mangers that would cuss people out.,3
Valuable career position,Excellent work experience.Utilized multiple software applications.Team collaboration across multiple departmentsFast-paced environment Empowered to make meaningful decisions affecting my position and the company,5
Productive,"Worked in Home Office as a Facilities Maintenance Coordinator.Answered phone calls and phone calls. Helped to organize meetings between service providers and our stores.",5
the most enjoyable part of the job,"Working in an industries with repeated successes increasing sales, gross margin dollars, inventory effIciencies improvement and risk reduction. Always committed to identifying and growing talent in large organizations embracing diversity and inclusion.  Collaborating with a cross-functional team, working on new strategies and to deliver exceptional results in challenging environments.",5
Corporate,You take the good with the bad. Sometimes things are great sometimes they are not. Corporate layoffs have become more prevalent in the passing years which sometimes creates a Culture of Fear that being said it's a job and they don't pay as terrible as some others,3
Starting Point,Good place to start if you want to get into retail office operations. Very few will advance from here but it shows you the workings of the company so you can possible transfer. Non stop calls and direction is weak. Not a job for those that take things personal,2
Taking care and learning from others,"Work three twelve hour shifts. The days go by quickly and always something to do.What I learn was usually personal and old school way of doing things and what is right by learning from people and their hardships. Always trying to make a positive out of everyone's day to sustain healthy work environment. Also, using safe work practices to be able to perform job functions, sustainability, and so we all can go home and see our families the way we came in.",5
Roc,"Great place to work until you become a threat to management.  Once you call them out on being wrong or breaking the law, they devote time to making sure you leave the company.",2
It all depends on which team you belong to..,"Walmart can be a great place to work, but the culture and guidelines that impact your day to day responsibilities can and do vary wildly between teams, even if they are in the same area! Some teams are laid back and you can come and go as long as you are getting your work down and are on top of everything.  Other teams are much more structured and offer little to no flexibility.  I worked in the IT division and we are treated much better (paid, time off, perks, wearing jeans to work, etc..) than our counterparts in the other divisions around the home office.",3
Productive working place,Wished I had never left I loved working for the company. The benefits were great. I was just not wanting to travel anymore. i would go back in a minute if I had the opportunity.,5
The most enjoyable part of the job,I loved working for Walmart.  I enjoyed the people that I had the privileged of working with.  I received an education that you cannot get from a University.,4
No job security.,My main gripe is  job security.   It seems like every six month they are   reorganizing and layoffs are random nobody knows if there job is secure.  While they provide assistance a chance to bid on other jobs in the company for 2 months after being laid off ?  Job opening don't match the amount laid off.,3
Working at walmart,"Working at Walmart gave me the opportunity to network , learn more about the company culture and what is expected of you throughout the years. Your opinion counts in many ways.",4
Walmart review,We were production based and were expected to meet the production given weekly. I would say the I learned the accounting aspect of freight. Management was ok although there was favoritism. The hardest part of the job was the research that was to be done. I think the best part of my job was the flexibility.,3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3

However, the environment is awful and slacking. Management is not good. We have some very nice people but overall it is not the best place. The training is lengthy and could be shortened and simplified. If you aren't a ""favorite"" you will be denied about everything and if you are you can get a way with a lot of things. I don't think it is a bad company just bad department.",2

Sam would not be pleased,"The culture Sam Walton exemplified is long gone though you must learn about it in orientation, it is left there my most.The rating systems for individual performance send mixed signals and it is impossible to be consistently rated or evaluated (this is especially true in the IT area).

A good place to work but no value for HR,"I loved my position at Walmart and worked there for many years. But as an HR professional I was consistently dismayed and disappointed in how undervalued and underutilized the function was. The most senior executive HR positions were always held by operations leaders waiting for their next Ops role. Field HR is tactical and administrative and spread VERY thin, considering each store does not have an HR manager. Little opportunity for advancement unles you want to move to Bentonville Arkansas.",3
Great place to work,Walmart offers many career opportunities and they promote heavily from within - particularly from store operations.Walmart is growing profitably and making great decisions about the ecommerce space.,5
Sitting at desk all day reconciling invoices.,Great place if you like sitting all day at a desk. A lot of office politics and backbiting. Management was rarely helpful. The lunch breaks were too short.,3

Difficult work/life balance,"travel was fun for awhile....but when you work 12+ hrs it tends to take away any fun.  The salary is not worth the time spent.  It was supposed to be a rotating day/night schedule per project, but it never happens and you basically work 12+ at night, sleep a few during the day and then back at it at night.  no work/life balance!",3
production,"Company needs to be more organized with training and ordering parts. Rude managers, a lot of unexpected work asked of techs and no compensation for extra work.",2

Workplace culture was good but they often would make decisions quickly and laid off staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a Team with some many  different and diverse individuals to accomplish goals.",4
Liars and bad management,"Management was known for only advancing and helping those who were out of work friends. They constantly lied and used graphs for months against employees for production, even when they were on Leave of Absence or any type of leave, as it did not actually specify days, and they refuse to show that. Management always told you one thing, and than threw employees under the bus by stating they never said it, requests for trying to get what was said in writing were ignored. They were the best at smiling to your face, but treating you like bad while doing so. We always got paid less than other companies for what we did. Walmart is a pro at telling everyone bad news, and trying to convince them its good for them. HR always sides with management and if you contest anything, they only refer you to talk to the same management that you have the issue with. The company refuses to actually help associates. The only good thing is the culture, as it is interesting and very wide spread.",1

Room to grow and learn,"I have seen some people get promoted that didn't deserve it and I have seen associates with over 20 years experience be ""walked"" out the door.  If you can't handle constant change don't work at Walmart.",4

Management is slow in decision making.",3

The most difficult thing about the job is always having to start many other tasks before completing the first ones given.

I learned how to use the computer and scanner on a forklift. The hardest part of the job was putting away pallets when there was pallets in the aisle from the shift before you and at the same time you have the replenish driver pulling pallets he needs at the same time.

"They Want Us To Be Big Tech, But Don't Pay Us Like We Are","Good atmosphere and good people. Open Door policies are endorsed which I like. However, There policies across the country, how they treat us salary and benefit wise is a sore spot. The culture is good, relaxed, and laid back but we don't get the credit I think we deserve. They pay us poorly because of our location, not realizing that location doesn't matter as much in the tech world anyway. They are turning their associates away because of bad beefits and that feels.....slimey to me because it is only the Bentonville office that suffers from this issue.

Walmart is huge and and any mistake can cost millions if not billions of dollars. The bad part is the terrible managers that get promoted and make life miserable for every employee. Management also plays favorites and if you are not a favorite no matter what you do its wrong. Until you get all documented to show what is going on, and then wow your not wrong. They want you to train on technologies but are unhappy when you take the time to do so.",4

"Great career development, lack of leadership","Wal-Mart has been a love-hate work relationship with me. You get to develop your skills at the largest retailer in the world. There are plenty of resources to develop yourself. Fixing a systemic issue can result in millions of dollars for the company so you really see the impact of what you are doing. The culture can be described as follows: Work from 7am to 530pm. Plenty of meetings, most resulting in no results. There is a wide gap in pay from the lower level associates to the higher level. Directors and above make a good amount of money, have good stock incentives, and a nice bonus. Lower level employees can make more money at other companies. Many people leave the company to get a raise, then come back in a couple years at a much higher level, doing the same job they did before they left. There is also a wide gap between the directors and lower level employees with technical skills. If you are a technical person, don't expect your boss to know more than how to use pivot tables in excel.",3

Solid Company,"No real complaints. Standard office environment. Company puts major emphasis on how much time you put in, not necessarily quality of work. Very competitive.",4
Decent place to work...,"No job security. Was told often that my job was ""safe"" then one day was laid off, out of nowhere. There are rounds of corporate layoffs several times per year. CEO is good, but the ""no cash registers in the home office"" attitude kills morale.",3
Replenishment Analysts,"A lot of suppliersa lot of Sku's100% Seasonal ItemsFast pacedHigh expectationsForecasting a lot of different types of itemsWeather driven category",3
Supply Chain Manager,"High paced environmentHigh volume, seasonal itemsHigh expectationTraining multiple suppliersMulti task positionHad direct reports in this position",3
A good company to work with,Good company to work and gain some knowledge on management and technical skills. Will get an onsite opportunity and can manage work-life balance. can work without worries,4
Great Opportunities,A dynamic company with a lot of opportunity to grow.  You can truly work hard and choose your own destiny.  It was a great place to start my business career.,4
Fun Working there,Working there was very sportive and The team i worked with real good and supportive in tough times. The team Lead helped with the work and encouraged a lot. We used have team lunches,5
Fast paced work environment,"You will not be bored working for this company.  They are forever changing and staying out in front of the competition.  The company is a great place to grow and learn the retail business.  The company culture is amazing and it was implemented to support the employees and everyone that does business with them.   The hardest part of working at Walmart/Sam's Club is the constant change without vetting if it is good for the business.  In addition, some of the long-term home office based leaders are a part of a good ole boy network and should be cycled out of role. International, Logistics, Sam's Club and Walmart operate in a silo and shouldn't. They are all under WMT Inc. and the divide is confusing. Although it has some leaders that do not represent the culture well it is an overall great company to work for.  It was founded on solid principals that are meant to help the company thrive in a competitive market.",3
Loved my team,I loved the team I worked for in the Walmart Foundation. It was a  small group of dedicated employees who cared for each other. We were making a difference in the business by supporting store giving and philanthropy.,4
Productive and good place to work,"Good place to work, friendly goal oriented people. The associates are top notch. Great place to learn new skills. Love the atmosphere  for the most part.",5
Walmart DC,"A typical day at work requires a lot of  physical ability , it is a very fast paced job , you have required production , I have learned how to use multiple receiving operating systems. I would have to say the most difficult part of the job is keeping up with production especially when you first start but when it comes to you the longer you are there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the hours worked I work a 3 day shift of 11 hours which leaves four days for a second job or just off days.",5
Productivity and safty high reguard,I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart Print Solutions I value all the skills I acquired. I have great respect for my supervisors and fellow workers. I look forward to returning.,5
Very good company in logistics,"I enjoyed working for Walmart.  I needed more than the position I held had to offer and became impatient.  Otherwise, I would still be with this company.  Leadership was extremely helpful and challenged all employees to be the best.",5
no job security,"I did learn a lot working at Walmart, and I worked with wonderful buyers and associates, but the past few years you always had to worry about being aught up in the next layoff.  That's what happened to me.",3
Great place no matter what level you are,Walmart is a great company to work for. They really work to give opportunity for employees to grow and learn and advance in their careers. there is great culture and the people are great.,5
Walmart,I spent 10 years with Walmart and i owe them everything. I learned so much and was able to have great mentors within the company that helped to further my career.,5
Strong management support,"Received extensive Business Analyst training.Great team members.  Not nearly enough conference rooms or parking at any of the office buildings.  I do not like being forced to provide feedback.",3
Great place to work,"Friendly staff, excellent benefits, great learning opportunity, good diversity, helpful peers and managers.  Bentonville is a quite place and everything is very close.  No traffic.  Good work life balance.",5
"People from NWA refer to Walmart as ""The Pressure Cooker""","I was told this when I had been working there a couple years when I went to the doctor for chest pain.  Apparently it was just the stress of the job.  There are departments that I do not think are like this but in the Finance pillar I do not know of a many individual areas/departments where this stress, pressure and lack of work life balance are not a significant issue.",2
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Good place to work but generally poor/untrained management,"The job is good, the training is sufficient, but the managers seem like slightly more senior employees and have little to no experience or capability in managing people.",4
Great company going through changes,"Walmart is a great company. When I started with them I would have recommend them to anyone and everyone. However the company is going through a lot of leadership changes at the moment. The company culture has become diluted, vision has lost focus, benefits continue to decline year over year, and the IT division is still dealing with the mushy middle problem.",3
Nice work environment,"This is a very quiet place to work, Good Team to work with, Managers are very supportive, Very Active place to work. Nice benefits and perks....................",5
Execlent,I enjoyed working for Walmart worked in the Dairy section stocking produces it was fun but worked nights. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people on a daily basis.,5
Family Values,A great place to work and thrive. Staff and managers were helpful and encouraging.  Weekly company recognitions were great as well. Great hours and opportunity for overtime.,5
Great Place to Work,"Great Job  Great Company no dislikes,great associates and Management Team, Job was very demanding and required lots of time at work to be successful completed my first year in management then promoted to Co-Manager over 125 million dollars in assets, ten move to Natchez to follow up over 85 million in assets",5
"Once you are in a wrong position, you are trapped","Working hour from 7:30 to 5:30. Are you kidding me? And claim your self as a tech company? Seriously? And another thing, why there are so many Indian workers? contractors and associates. Free coffee is good. But it's not a good place to work and not even comparable with those leading tech company in silicon valley. Make your way out ASAP, even though the salary is decent.",3
Very old style and not willing to change culture and management,"Too many waves of lay offs. Employee moral is very low due to lack of sense of job security. Management prefers to bring in their friends, people that worked at Dell.",1
Learned a lot while I worked here!,The knowledge and advancement that you are offered in this company are wonderful.  You always have full support of management in furthering your education and knowledge.,5
"Long hours, good pay","Long hours, good pay, mostly good people, some bad as anywhere else, stressful, competitive, lots of classes, good career options, cafeteria and coffee shops.",4
Wal-Mart,"For my duration at Walmart eCommerce, the co-workers and managers were extremely helpful and friendly. There wasn't one boring moment between the cooking days and working and other fun functions. I would implore anyone to work with this company.",5
Changing priorities made it difficult,"The last team I worked on had seemingly daily-changing priorities, which were a challenge to implement and understand. The is a tremendous shift to downsize the staff at Home Office.",3
no security with a job at walmart,I worked there for 9 years and my job was at risk 4 different times before I was finally laid off with such a big group I was not able to find another position in the company leaving me jobless for a year before I could find anything.,2
Cut Throat environment,A typical day is filled with updating of reports and interaction with senior management. I have learned that I can't trust everyone with confidential information. Management doesn't seem to care and is checked out. The culture of Walmart is great if you can get over the politics. The hardest part of the job is being walked all over. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist associates in moving their careers.,2
"Productive, busy, fast-paced, easy to get recognized.","Answer the phone, document call, work tickets, help your team, identify trends, handle business critical issues, and email. EMAIL EMAIL!  Management are all decent and willing to listen, strict and fair. The team was definitely more like a family, love 'em hate 'em but you all work together for one goal. Sometimes the sheer volume can be overwhelming but as long as everyone is doing their part it's not too bad.  One thing that is nice is that when you are consistently doing an outstanding job you DO get recognized. Consequently the inverse is true as well, if you consistently do a poor job you WILL get recognized for that as well.",4
No longer who I thought they were,"In my time with the company, i saw many changes in Operations, some were good but most were not good. The company stopped putting the spotlight on people for doing what is right, it then became very negative results driven. I was pregnant with my daughter when we went through corporate restructuring...translation is I lost my job.",3
Amazing company with a great vision and values but going through a painful transition,The traditional family culture of Walmart is being replaced by a more cut throat culture. Still a wonderful company. HR is not very supportive. Company is innovative and executes very well.,4
Good company,"Good employer to work for, better opportunities.... it has great variety of geographical diversity and has multiple locations to pick from and a fun place to work",3
Not the great company it once was.,"It's an OK place to start your career, but don't plan on staying long.  In my experience, loyalty is not rewarded.  Get out as quickly as possible. They are trying to restructure and update their business model to adapt to the new retail environment, with mixed results so far. These 'restructures' have been devastating to many many long-term employees who, I believe, are viewed as liabilities by the new leadership. Based on my experience, you shouldn't expect work-life balance with corporate-level positions.  You should expect to work many late nights and weekends.  Supervisors aren't really concerned about the number of hours you work.  They are only concerned about getting the work done and impressing senior management. Sadly, all of the great leaders who were involved in building the company are now long gone.  I believe, much of the current mid-level management (VP, Senior Director) is completely ineffective, more concerned with their careers than what's best for their teams or the company.  These are also the people who never seem to be impacted by the now all-too-frequent restructures. That said, I do like the new CEO and some of the other most-senior leadership, and I am hopeful they will return the company to greatness someday.",1
Very productive and positive place to work,"Working here at Walmart corporate is a great place to work, filled with a bunch of skill and hardworking talent around you and such a positive work environment.",5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Productive,This by far has been the best company I have ever worked for they value their employees there's always the option of potential for growth within the company.,4
Good company-hard on management,A very strong company that utilizes large buying power to provide goods for customers. A typical day at work starts at 8am-8pm or 8pm-8am.  I was well trained and gained much experience from the company. The culture is guided toward low end promotions low end raises for the hourly associates.,2
Ethical and Advancing company,"Walmart's culture is all about respect for the individual. This is a key component of Walmart's core values. It's a vision that has been cast across the nation and across the world. Because of this vision, Walmart has become an extremely ethical company. Walmart wants its employees to feel that their voice can and will be heard. Also, Walmart offers so many advancement opportunities. These opportunities do not just come from within the company, but outside the company as well. With the knowledge you gain in any position at Walmart, you can take your newly acquired skills up the corporate ladder or start at another company and make a quick and positive impact. I was glad to work at Walmart as a HR Coordinator at the Home Office. Because of the skills I gained, I know I can make a positive impact anywhere.",5
Stressful and uncertain,"A little like walking through a haunted house.  Just when you think you are safe, some crazy zombie jumps out and axes you.  For no good reason.  I mean, all you are doing is walking through the house.",1
Stressful and uncertain,In the years that I worked at Walmart I can honestly say that I drank the koolaid.  I believed this was a family oriented company.  I did my best and received excellent reviews.  When my position was eliminated it was almost as if I had been disowned by a family member.,1
Walmart Home Office: Organized Chaos,"I love working at Walmart. The job that I hold now is tedious and repetitive, but it's really the people that make it fun. Management is great. As far as scheduling... it's organized chaos unless you choose to have a set schedule. Other than that, pretty good place to work for.",4
"Ok pay, high stress","I liked working at walmart until the last couple years. Then the layoffs came, and keep coming. Teams are slashed and the remaining associates are left to pick up the work leading to heavy workloads, tight deadlines, and high stress. Work life balance is preached but not followed.",3
Stressful with constant reorganization,"You can learn a lot in Walmart as there are a lot of good projects and opportunities to work on those projects. Organization has not yet landed on a strategy. There are constant job cuts and employee morale is low.",2
No Review,"I am choosing to not review at this time, company changed when the founder passed away. The culture was not the same, the care for fellow associates were not the same.",4
A busy and competitive day of work,"work assigned or a task set for the day of work is a good start, make the difference for our customers. have opportunities to be train for new task assignments is the best way to learn.management verbal communication with associates is good at work.Workplace Culture It’s how we deliver superior customer service, create a great front-line work environment and improve performance in order to achieve our common purpose of saving people money so they can live better. that make happy our customers.the hardest part of my job is to train to do nothing for a customer.have the opportunity to meet people from another countries and their cultures all under one ruff, Walmart.",3
Team Building,"Love the Team buildingDiverse workplace goodend of month spreadsheets was always the hardest for me.cross training was fun.Loved the advance classes that was offered.",3
Stressful,"The job was reconciling bank to store deposits. Since it was starting a new job function they were training us for, they made up step by step guidelines to follow which was nice except they made 27 changes within a 2 week period which made it impossible to learn. Had they perfected the job details before they brought people on, it could have been a very nice job. But as it was, it was very stressful.",1
decent place,It's a decent place to work but if you are a female you have to work twice as hard for half the pay. It is part of the culture and management condones it.,3
Deteriorating work culture,Walmart is an amazing organization that has been exceptionally good to me. I accepted a role with eCommerce and deeply regret my decision as it isn't Walmart.,3
Productive and fun environment,"Fun place to work I enjoyed all the way met great people, I remain true to our founding values of quality, honest and hard work, respect the individual. I have the highest ethical standards in the industry. ""do the right thing"" I'm a business based on trust.",5
If you choose to work for Walmart,"Overall, is a good company but currently going through major restructures so not able to speak to what it will look like tomorrow. There are lots of opportunities but recognize that the market is changing and long term employment is no longer as likely an outcome as it once was.",3
Really nice place to work. The people here are fantastic!,"A typical day at work consists of assisting Walmart stores with Merchandise issues.  I.e., Lack of or too much merchandise. I have learned how to manage my time on the clock to exceed exceptions allotted for that  job.   Management is very knowledgeable and helpful to all employees.  The hardest part of the Job is when work is slow, I always ask for other jobs to do.  They most enjoyable part of my job, are the people I work with.  Some of the best I have every known.",5
sucks,"sucks, really really sucks as a place and the culture and people are substandard, substandard low live people unworth getting to know. Would't work here even if my life depended on it",1
N/a,Walmart do not pay or treat employees will. Management want you to fit in as a team but the managers do not have good team building skills. The company is also pretty bad at placing employees in the correct position basined on the skill level.,1
Early Years better than present times.,"My 15 plus years at WALMART were good years. Lots of changes in retail. Relocated several times to advance with the company. Made lots of friends, made lots of memories. Those were the ""Good Old Days.""",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
garbage,garbage place to work did not enjoy myself at all would not tell anyone to get a job here they micro manage you nonstop don't care if youre sick or need to do something just make you work work work even get mad when you don't want to work overtime.,1
Fast Paced Stressful enviroment,Monday Mornings the weeks starts with a very fast pace. Short period of time to review performance over the weekend and how that effects forecasts. Then on to meetings to review and explain.,4
"Fast Paced, great co-workers, limited benefits.","I enjoy the people I work with, not necessarily the people I work for, just like alot of jobs, you have your good and bad parts. Overall not too bad a place to work.",3
Completely depends on where you work,"Overall, Walmart is a good place to work, but the increased competitive pressures and lack of sufficient re-investments in systems enhancements is overwhelmingly frustrating.   Constant pressure to do more with less, coupled with the lack of systems investment, delays progress and increases pressures on middle managers to muscle through and always find a way to make it happen.  Work-Life balance gets completely out of whack most weeks in the year.",4
Why to and not to work for walmart,Too many organizational changes making it sometimes hard to know what direction you'll be going and there by by makes it hard to sometime know what to invest on as technology going forward especially for the fact that it's a company your plan to stay there,4
Great coworkers,Workplace culture is great. The job is very fast paced and requires multitasking skills. Strong customer service skills for both internal and external customers are a must.,3
Dreadful,"The culture is not as company projects. Overworked employees with no work-life balance.Alot of backbiting and dishonesty.Unrealistic  goals - all of which are supposed to ""save money/live better"" which is of course, at the cost of the hourly associates which are the backbone of this company. Greedy corporate citizen with liberal mores and values. Most enjoyable part of the day at walmart home offie - going home.",1
decent place to work,Walmart is doing a great job of figuring out how to stay relevant in the ever changing landscape of real estate.  Walmart is somewhat competitive between employees,4
High volume fast paced environment.,"If you enjoy a high paced high pressure environment, then this is the company for you. There are many great people from all walks of life that you get the opportunity to learn from.",4
"Poor management at WalMart. Too many non-technical, high school dropouts at senior management level","Poor management at WalMart. Too many non-technical,  at senior management level. Very hard to get promoted unless you are in their network. Promotions are not based on merit.",1
Walmart Home office review,A typical day in the position of a resolution specialist would consist of taking back to back phone calls of either customers or associates complaining and sometimes complimenting other associates for their work. The only part I did not like was that you were based on a point system for your attendance and if you got up to 9 points because you were sick you would get fired.,5
Typical day,The hardest part of the job is attempting to balance all the incoming deductions to be researched with the number of Associates allowed on the Team. Great company to work for.,5
fast paced,faced paced and work was expected to be done in a timely matter. Most of the leadership is very fair and great to work for. The true culture that Walmart was founded on is very solid,5
Great place to work.,I loved working at Walmart.  Plenty of room for advancement and they will train from within. Fun environment and very understanding management when it comes to family.,3
overall busy and time consuming,Honestly its a good place to start when you are young of age but not so when you have children and are older than 25. In short the company is good for youth,4
"No Congruancy, things change on a dime and usually not for the better.  Accounting systems take time to implement and receive feedback","I think that where you work is a part of your life that should be looked forward to everyday.  Good leadership is EVERYTHING! Accounting changes were not given long enough to access the success of the programs implementation.  Accounting programs were dinosaurs, so it was required to use 2 to 4 or more systems to complete what could have been done more efficiently and cost effective.  Band aids of different accounting software were used to save money, instead of buying new programs when needed.  As a result, it became an impossible situation and cost more money in the long run than would have initially.   I did enjoy the Home Office Culture, due to it's founders, it was more visible and integral in earlier years.   I will always have a respect for the founders of the company and the impact they had on their community and the principles they lived by and built their company on.  Amazing people, Amazing Leaders!   I would like to see the company return to it's grass roots, it was much more of a family and what is best for the customer and their employees.   Excellent leaders and excellent customer service are a win-win.  Problem solving can be fun and exciting, and take the company to new heights.  Thank you",4
Retail,"Walmart was/is highly competitiveWalmart was/is very stressful and there was little or no work life balanceWalmart was/is unfair to human capital that did not start in a store",3
Walmart,"I have worked on walmart for 13 years, the culture continued to change where they no longer care about their associates, we were told there was open door polices with no retaliation , found out that is not true.Our team has been short staffed and the new Walmart way is they are trying to automate all the jobs so there are no employees they will have to pay , it became very stressful . The more enjoyable part was the great friends i made while working there, they are amazing caring people . Management has changed , it became all about numbers and productivity instead of lets get together and work as a team that we and make our team great. New mangers are not required to learn the job of the teams, so how could a new manager support our needs if you dont understand what your employess do. It was very discouraging.",2
Great place to start a career,Without a doubt one of the best companies I've worked for thus far.  Great place to work if you're looking to make a career move. The only downfall is the uncertainty of Job Security. I would recommend this company to anybody who wants to accept the challenge of the corporate world.,5
none,Walmart does not value family and is mainly for single people and its all about who you know if you ever want to advance in this company. that is all.,5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Productive and company involvement,"Very good company to work for in Bentonville. very involved in communities.  Good cultureI worked for a great department, I have learned to respect all peopleThey provided open training for new systems and benefits",3
Company Review,"Great place if you have the right management. Be careful to trust but verify. If you are looking for quick advancement, you must network yourself. It is a competitive market",4
Great place to work,Good company and lots of opportunity for advancement.  If you work hard then you will be rewarded.  Be prepared to start out in an entry level position.,4
Very stressful place to work,"Most of my work day was sitting and working on my computer.I learned a LOT about commercial energy management, maintenance, project management, property management and building controls systems.The culture had gone downhill since I began with Walmart home office in 1996.The hardest part of the job was the associate unfairness and inequality within the department.The most enjoyable part of the job was the rare business travel and when we got together as a team.",3
Rapidly evolving workplace,"Walmart associates have the unique opportunity to affect millions of people every day. While the company is massive, each department is very lean and many groups function as startups trying to secure funding from corporate leadership to execute competing ideas. With the recent layoffs, teams have become increasingly lean - causing the environment to become even more competitive.",3
Productive and Fun.,"Dress was casual but clean.Fellow associates are wonderful to work with.Worked with a team.Sense of belonging, family.Expanding of knowledge possible and encouraged.Great coffee bars in the facilities.",4
Relaxed environment.,"Wanted things done accurately but no much sense of urgency.People are very nice yet competitive.Dress is very casual.Several systems have to work together to accomplish one process.",3
Don't do it,"Don't do it. Walmart is a cult. They will control every aspect of your life, and demand 100% loyalty, but show almost none in return. They are nearly always deceptive, frequently lying outright, and do not care one iota about your personal life. They will act like they do occasionally, but it is all superficial. Lots of politics and long hours.",1
Typical Day at work,Daily contribution to to product line quality control reporting. Also investigate and resolve customer dissatisfaction in a timely and empathetic manner.,4
This is a fun place to work,The work was repetitive and it could be difficult to get time off.  The hardest part was standing for long periods of time.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers.,4
Extremely Busy,"I worked for Wal-Mart Inc for 20yrs. I worked in the stores for 10 years worked in every area in the store from the check outs to departments, layaway and claims clerk. I transferred to the home office and started in accounting on the help desk and moved to the people divisions RPA and then on to girlswear merchandising. I learned many valuable life lessons while working for this company they were always good to me.",4
Too Big,Event though there were several thousand people working in the corporate office there were many instances of the good ol boy network. CEO got into politics too much instead of working for shareholders.,2
Stressful,Sit down take calls up to 3 hours till first break and so on. So boring.Not much advancement. Lots of favoritism and no fun in the call center. Highly upset with the feeling in here.,3
All about Numbers Not People,I hate to say it but its true. I worked for this company for over 18 years and the culture has changed drastically! Pay is not worth the stress to say the least,2
Not Productive,"Working for this company is becoming a scary issue. A typical day was extremely busy with direction changing constantly. The one thing I enjoyed, was the people!",2
Looking for opportunity then look no futher,I came to the call center very optimistic mostly because this was a complete turn around from store to office setting and call center.  Everything went well and I found fellow managers and agents that were very excited to learn the next job to further a career with the company!,4
Great Culture,I enjoyed my time working in Walmart Technology. The work culture is amazing and everyone works together in a seamless fashion for such a big company. It still amazes me how everything comes together since there so many different things.,5
Walmart is exhausting,"Walmart starts out making you think its the greatest company in the world, and then you find out it's not what it's made out to be.  When the original owners had the company it was so much more interesting and now it's just another bottom line is the only thing that matters.",2
Excellent work place,Walmart is an excellent company to work for with plenty of career opportunities. It has a very strong culture and respect diversity. Walmart is working on the right process improvements to prepare to company for the future.,5
Room for advancement,There was plenty of room for advancement within the company. They offered classes to improve your skills and education as well. Not a bad place to work.,4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3

very good,"Excellent company. Great culture, structure and room for advancement. Strong sense of support for employees with extremely challenging and excellent projects, programs and people.",4
Workplace Culture,The workplace culture is awesome. They company is very active in diversity and inclusion for all walks of life. The majority of people are encouraging and uplifting when associates are going through a difficult place in their lives.,4
Good Workplace,"A typical day at work would be goodI have learned the architecture of the Replenishment SystemManagement and work place is goodThe enjoyable part is the challengening environment",4
Good people,Good work life/balance. Management is always trying to be accommodating to needs of your family or personal issues.  The higher up you go the more stressful but rewarding the job can be.,4
Not willing to make meaningful change,"Worked many years with the company as an Assistant And Co Manager. The market I spent the most time in never had core issues addressed. Instead, there was a long parade of market managers that would replace store managers over a 2-3 year period before they were ultimately replaced themselves.",4
High expectations,"Excellent place to build skills and learn from others. Expectations are always high.Managers and mentors were genuinely invested in helping associates grow.",4
Walmart Corporate Review,"Typical Day at my level is performing various business functions, or finishing up projects or presentations and attending meetings. They don't discourage doing things on your own and making mistakes is fine as long as your manager can see the logic. I like that about this place. You get a chance to work with a ton of people and typically they are very helpful.",4
There is nothing positive to say,Nothing positive to say about this company.  Walmart treats their employees terrible.  No consistency.  If you're a favorite you can do anything.  If you're not than be prepared to get in trouble all the time.,1
"Mixed Culture,","Stress, lacks work life Balance in most positions.  There are some great people here, but there are some that only see bottom line as the source of managing.",2
Largest retailer reinventing itself,Highly productive and competitive environment. Geared towards innovation. Trying to do more with less. Finding a balance between work and life is hard sometimes.,4
Job Work/Life Balance,It helped with being able to work from home when you or the kids were sick.  Walmart also helped with developing further skills for learning in a variety of computer languages including decision-making in design of software components.,4
walmart life in 4 years,Walmart is good for young kids looking for a job after high school or young adults looking for a stable job. If done right Walmart can also be a good career. work environment isn't always pleasant and can be very stressful at times do to other employees and management.,3
It was great in the beginning...,It was great until they got a new leadership in my team.  The outsourcing and re-badging needs to stop.  The work environment got way too stressful beginning of July 2017 and the future of the team appears uncertain.,3
Horrible,The management was horrible. Everyone was treated like trash. Unless of course you made 100k a year. Then you got treated like you were on a pedi stool.,1
it was alright,"I worked for Wal-mart Neighborhood market. Opened the location in Bentonville across from the harps, The manager at the time was a great guy and I enjoyed working for him. His assistant managers however is a different story. They where too passive aggressive and looked down upon the other employees. one in particular I did not agree with nor he agree with me. I did what I could to keep our interactions to a minimum so that I could avoid a workplace dispute. But he had his plans and would seek out trouble with the other employees and make it difficult for them too. When we all reported it to our manager little action was taking besides a light reprimanding. When it came to Verbal abuse from the assistant manager I spoke with my manager about but still nothing. I put in my two weeks and haven't bothered to seek further at Wal-Mart after that.",3
Demanding yet rewarding place to work,"Walmart has a culture of working very hard and putting the customer first.  It has a formula that works very well for traditional big box retail.  It's struggling to be successful in e-commerce, but is making logical moves to strengthen e-market presence.",3
Productive and Fast Paced enviroment,It was a pleasant experience overall while working here. Management and Co-workers are extremely friendly and they provide a good support group if any questions needed to be asked.,3
Legacy management practices,"So stuck in 1960s top down management they don't relize it.  They say all the modern management things, but they are so set in old ways it isn't even obvious to them.",2
Will learn a lot,"Overall, Walmart is a great place to work. You will learn a lot and it is a fast pace environment because of the evolution of Retail.  My recommendation is to learn as much as possible while there.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Good,This is a good place to work. There are a lot of opportunities to grow in this department.  The managers and staff were helpful and nice to work with. The environment is also warming and a great place to achieve with productivity and teamwork.,4
Experience,"I have worked at Walmart for almost 10 years.  The work experience I have gained over the years has been incredible.  Customer Service, Flexibility, Decision Making, Effective Communication, etc.",3
I worked for the best team.,I worked for the best team within the company.  It was a great experience.  I wouldn't trade the experience & companionship for anything.  I was able to expand my knowledge outside the basic legal scope of the business.,3
Enjoyable part,"My favorite part of the day was working with my field associates.  I enjoyed the managers, clerks, and human resource managers and clerks I worked with out in the field.",3
Training,"You were promised training and never received it.  I enjoyed the assignment and workplace atmosphere.  People very friendly.I learned a lot during this assignment.",2
productivity and good environment,Good place and environment  to work.                 Some times stressful.   Good benefits and pay ..                  Need more floor support for my job.,4
"Fun, competitive environment!",Walmart is the perfect place to work and learn the ropes of retail.  You can't get a better education than working for them.  Not always 8-5 and some Saturdays required.,5
Lacks Culture and Development,If you are a Millenial. The culture will be very slow and very little opportunity for career growth. There is a lot of reorganization and management is too busy to develop associates. Lacks diversity in Home Office setting.,2
Extremely stressful and cut-throat (Home Office only),"Long days required to get the job done, including sometimes having to give up vacations.  Cut throat co-workers, favoritism was apparent  Terrible work / life balance. Company more interested at meeting their goals than what was going on with your family.",3
Unstable and poor culture,"Poor culture; Unstable job environment due to competition from Amazon; Stressful; lots of politics; lots of friction with eCom team in San Jose, CA; would not recommend anyone to join the company;",1
Nice place to work,I strongly believe that this is a nice place to work. Amazing work life balance for an man level job. Small work force so you get a lot of responsibility early on.,4
"Challenging, Fast Paced environment.  New opportunities","Leadership will take time to develop your skills and experiences.  Work Life Balance and the ability to work remote is often available.  Opportunities are abundant with mentoring available, job shadowing, and continued education.",5
Bad work culture,Very cut throat attitude among employees. Lots of layoffs. Stock is decreasing. Very poor management leadership.   Strict travel rules and budgets.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,2
No frills retailer in transition,Traditional brick and mortar retailer with designs at becoming a major e-commerce player.  Walmart culture is integrated into everything at the home office (all meetings begin with the walmart or Sam's cheer) and understanding that culture is a key to success.,4
Corporate Security,Corporate security is great for someone looking for a reactive job. There is little work to do until there is something generated. The managament does not seem to have a full grasp on how to organize themselves or the department. Little gets accomplished with lots of busy work in between. If you get the position or schedule you want hold on to it or it will be gone. Great place to work to get to know friendly people.,4
Quick paced and great management,Worked with a great team to help accomplish the transportation needs that were required of us to make sure facilities had the items picked up and delivered on time to ensure customer satisfaction.,5
The biggest and best company on the Planet,"If you want to make an impact on the planet, Walmart will give you the platform to do so. Everything you do impacts millions and millions of customers all over the world.",5
"In general, a good place to work.",System group iscurrently going through a tech modernization program to become a digital company.  A considerable number of positions have been eliminated recently and more reductions are expected.,3
Great Company,"Great Company to work for and to be a part of, lots of room for advancement in the many divisions and departments. Moving around can be a bit challenging with interview process.",4
Temp work at home office,"Keep in mind that your direct manager on the job is not, and has so little to do, with the people who decide your employment when you're temp at walmart.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Great working environment.,Very diverse. You meet a lot of interesting and good people. Team work is big there. You have good chances to grow and advance there. I had a great experience there.,4
Hard for minority,"Not a  place you can be yourself. Management shows favoritism. I been there a year and they had 4 Mass Fires, hundreds of people lost their jobs. Jobs are not secure at Walmart at all.",2
"Good Job, don't buy the ""Family"" hype","Worked long term and was well compensated.  Coworker's were really great people, however leadership spoke a lot to ""Family"" but made decisions daily that demonstrated you were really just an employee.  Take the talk with a grain of salt, leadership feels no guilt in laying off talented experienced associates to achieve their goals and bonuses.",3
Acting Out Desperation on Associates,"There is a strong sense that everybody is in it for themselves. While Walmart has the resources to bring in top talents around the world, it has yet to learn how to keep these talents. The advancement opportunities are challenging to say the least;  ranks, status, and class are extremely important as much as they tell you otherwise; innovation from the rank and file are not embraced, but once the senior management decided something has to be done it is their way or highway. The ""open door policy"" is a joke. You will be thrown out the door if you ever dare to challenge your management for their wrong doing or dishonesty. In my two years I have seen at least 12 rounds of layoffs at this company. Too much instability and uncertainty.",3
n/a,Company moral on a corporate level is different from a store level. Management was very understanding of problems and accommodated accordingly. Great work place.,3
Administrative Assistant,"When I first joined  Walmart, it was my first job in a different country.  As soon as I started, the assistant I had to report to, just handed all the work (piles and piles of tasks that hadn't been done ... hardly any training .. it was a sink or swim situation.  After I got the hand on things, everything improved",2
Ok,Ok at best . Read the cons section. At least I was employed for over 9 years and was able to learn and build my career.  Now I have to start  from the bottom,3
good place to work,I have enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot as there isnt a typical day at Walmart. It is a dynamic culture that require strong leadership and collaboration skills,4
It's up to you,"You can make whatever you want of this company. Just like most jobs, it's just a matter of how what kind of work life balance you want. Most managers start as hourly. That's not just something they say. Managers can make very good money. Hourly associates can also make pretty good money. Work hard, show up on time. Really not difficult.",4
Workplace culture,"Management does not necessarily have the skills to manage the teams they are in charge of.  Once a person's skills are known, easily can be taken advantage of by being asked to ""help out"" others and made to feel guilty if leaving work on time.  Enjoyed friendships made during the time there.",2
walmart overview,"I started at the optical lab which in this facility it was air conditioned and involved light lifting and minimum walkingafter 9 years I transferred to the reclaim warehouse in Bentonville this building is a metal building with no work area ac which requires continuous heavy lifting and two small breaks are given in a ten hour period inadequate for any decent lunch break. For a older person I would not recommend this job location.",4
Best place I have worked,"Working here I felt like I was part of a family.  My management had my back when a personal situation effected my performance and stood behind me to get through it,  I lost two family members while employed at Walmart and they were very supportive during that trying time.",4
Great company to work for - apart from middle management issues and politics,"Fantastic culture, great message, true belief in work/life balance.   Poor middle management (most VP's and above are great...directors and below are all about maintaining the status quo).     Every job I've had here was highly political (I've had many).  ""Perception is reality"" is bandied about relentlessly.  Project management is all about money and dates, not really much maturity in quality deliveries or usable products. Scale works for you - when you do something cool it affects 2 million associates or millions upon millions of customers.  You can be an engineer one year, an HR representative 3 years later, and an IT manager 3 years after that.  Walmart offers unparalleled job diversity.    Scale also works against you, to get something done you need to know the right people and build the right relationships or walls of red tape will appear out of nowhere.   Overall, it's a great company to work for (speaking from a home office perspective).  Management woes are not unusual, the ability to navigate a political environment is a must, and you can easily find glass ceilings if you go against the grain of your manager's style.  I could just be a difficult/hard to manage associate, but I've had approximately 10 bosses and only 3 of them I would recommend to others.",4
Great Place to Grow,Walmart is one of the largest companies in the world making it an awesome place to start a career and learn the ins and outs of the different areas in the retail industry.,5

Everything I am today I learned for Walmart,"Walmart is a great company to work for. You learn so much really fast. They want you to be successful. They will listen to your ideas and change if needed. If you are successful so are they. They understand it's the associates that make them successful. They really drive home dedication, flexibility, and reliability. It's their core for each associate to be this type of person.",5
"Productive environment with good culture, dedicated and engaged management.","Overall experience was positive, gained great business and IT knowledge and had the opportunity to engage with great co-workers and experts in a variety of fields.",4
Hourly Supervisor,Supervised 78 hourly associates for Walmart.com. Performed customer escalation resolutions. Wrote evaluations. Performed interviews for new hires. Assisted in investigations on performance issues.,4
renewed IS facility,"ISD just got refurbished, though now a ghost town due to jet.com aquisition, other M&A activities. Senior PM experience is being sacrificed for newley-minted MBA's, and/or coders with additional tasking of project management as a facilitation effort to deliver. CEO 'support the associates' approach is meant for hourly employees in the stores, NOT the back-office professionals.",2
An awesome job at a company with the ability to change the world,I learned marketing fundamentals by while having the ability to work on various types of projects and businesses. Everything centered on putting the customer first.,4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Excellent and fun workplace.,I really enjoyed working here and I am really thankful that I got this opportunity to work hear and learn new skills. Overall a great place to work. I really recommended this place to work.,5
Good environment,"The work was not hard and you had help all around.  Easy to get help anywhere you look, but they are very by the book.  they follow policies strictly, which lead to my termination.",4
Need to accommodate various learning styles,The position I was placed in required training in a training room. As an individual who does not do well in a training room environment this was not a very good fit for me.,3
Very political,"Rather refrain from sharing.  Working harder rather than smarter mindset.  - Old associates unwilling to embrace change.  If it ain't broken, do not fix it mentality. - Middle managers protecting their role and seniority at the expense of others.",2
The Return Center was a good place to work,At the Return Center everyone work as a team.  The Management was good to work with the assonant and make sure the work environment was good  and your got overtime.,3
You had to work as a team.,"This was a productive fast pace working environment.  You had to work as a team. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Management was good.",2
Ok,Has good culture and advancement. I guess you have to like speaking on the phone to enjoy this job- and helping people of course. Its not as bad as customer service/Customer relations. Here you can actually help people more and its a smaller team. Less than 30,3
hostile work environment,No job security. There is a lot of backstabbing and fighting to get to the top. Consistent unethical behavior from supervisors. No respect for individuals. Consistent retaliation for associates that utilize the open door policy.,1
Easy to work with people.,"I never expected to ever work for Walmart as I didn't know much of their culture and had bad views about them. However that all changed once I started working there.  As an Application Developer I get to do many fun project related to web and native applications.  The Culture there is amazing. People are so nice and they respect you and listen to what you have to say.  Also teams are very supportive of each other and thats once of the things i love the most working there.",5
Stressful,"a typical day running reports and managing supplier needs, Management team are not so good there's alot a micro managing. The culture of the company is nothing like it was a few years ago and based on seasonal employees its not what Sam Walton based his company on. The hardest part about this job there was no accurate training you will need to be a self starter and motivator and find ways to learn the job, the supervisors currently in the role don't care anymore. Most enjoyable part of the job is other members on your team and in the company",3
Competitive Salary and Benefits yet no work life balance or job security.,Competitive Salary and Benefits yet no work life balance or job security. Constant Layoffs especially affecting long term associates. Can not make a life long career due to round after round of Layoff's,2
Productive Large Company,"Overall great experience,  once you work here there is not much you can't do.  They have a way of moving their leaders around so that they can gain additional work experience and skills",4
Good Store,"Nice people, busy, lots of diverse merchandise. Picking set schedules is a plus. Not enough parking and the HO workers think they own you. Something you'll have to get used to is waiting forever in the check out line",4
The Worst Managers,"No additional training was given if someone made a mistake, only consequences. Help was not provided, other co-worker still there when she is not people friendly",2
Awful company,"Promotions are not based on experience or qualifications, but based upon who you know and who likes you. Awful hours and work/life balance is practically non-existent. The company doesn't listen to its workers and doesn't really care about you as part of the team. Upper management doesn't do their jobs at ALL. They wont do their one-on-ones or help you with your IDP. They dont want to see you advance.",3
A plus!,I really enjoyed my time at Walmart. I was able to promote from their call center to being a workmans comp adjuster and eventually worked my way to being a Sr Adjuster.,5
"Great place to work, but you have to put your time in.",Despite some of the negative press Walmart can be a good spring board into other forms of retail work. There are many positions in the store this includes working on the floor or behind the scenes operations.,4
Competitive in the Job Market,"Fast paced, real time environment.  Made great work contacts and formed friendships throughout the US.  Associate discount is a nice benefit.  Not enough work/life balance as working 10+ hours a day and weekends creates a burnout.",3
Great place to work. Awesome bonus and stocks,Worked for walmart for 17 years and loved it. Recent management changes with the acquisition of .com sites has made it unstable for long term associates.,4
Change in company culture,"The company culture changed a lot in the time I was there.  The company does not focus on the Associate the way it claims.  If your focus is solely on career and do not mind a disproportionate work/life balance that is weighed heavily on work, you will be fine.",2
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Walmart's Marketing Department - a great place to work,Walmart's Marketing Department has exceptional leadership who are actively engaged in bringing out the best in their associates and are constantly encouraging striving for work/life balance.  Work/life balance is very difficult though as most associates are deeply committed to their work and fulfilling the current mission/vision.  There is so much going on at this giant that it is easy to spread yourself too thin.  The best part is the caliber and integrity of the associates.  Absolutely first class!,5
The most enjoyable part of the job.,"Implementing new software systems. Working with cross functional teams. Learning new software systems. Enjoying the digital direction Walmart is moving to now, and in the future.",4
"Good pay, bad work life","Was a great place to move up. Started as an Hour ASC but through a lot of hard work and late nights was able to be promoted. We have slot of new good data but takes a lot of work to build it all out Wich causes you to work slot of hours trouble shooting issues. You are expected to support multiple catgs and be an expert in all of them, which causes you to work late slot.",3
Working with great associates,Walmart hires great people but they are not loyal to those people. There is supposed to be respect for the individual but that sometimes does not happen.,3
Great company to advance in.,Walmart allows the opportunity for their employees to advance within the company. Management and employees work together to have a balance work life and personal life that suits both the employer and employees. They work to keep their employees satisfied with their jobs.,5

Unfortunately, with the new restructuring my position was removed. So even though I loved my job, got nothing but great feedback on my work, and always had a positive attitude, I was just a replaceable as the associate next to me.

Walmart was a fun place to work. But the culture is changing,I had the tools and authority to do my job and assist the customers as needed. What I have seen is Walmart has new upper level management and they are not following the Walmart culture.,3
Employee Scorned,The company culture has changed.  Management has too much power over other people's lives.  The company promises a lot by relocating them to the area and delivers very little by providing them information on the lay-offs and disrupting their lives..,3
Awesome Experience,"Very advance technology but is very fugal in other areas.  Need to invest more in people at the lower management level.  I love the security and utilizing top of the line technology to test, track, and implement quickly.",3
Senior Inventory Coordinator,I review orders on the order days to make sure the number of units were not going to over stock a club. If I determined the order was incorrect I would reach out to the supplier and cancel the order and begin working through the process of identifying what the issues were.  I would check out of stocks and determine why the club was out of stock. I handled member requests for additional product.,4
Great technology location to do things not possible anywhere else,"Walmart Inc,was the last place on my radar for my career in IT Security which turned out to be the very place where I could take action, try new tactics, mentor others, and influence an industry that is very lucrative and fairly new-er! It is like drinking from a fire hose all of the time and technologists are never bored there. This especially goes for application development. Opportunities to resolve problems and learn more about anything are available in the conversations that you choose. You can be a part of anything, it is the culture there and there are numerous brilliant, effective people all around you. Be prepared for a start-up mentality where you may not see the effects of what you contribute initially, but keep standing in the truth of your tasking. You will see this massive technology ship's rudder turn ever so slightly and then your idea is working as people are using it to resolve their issues or just do something better, faster,  in 28 countries! I got to share with technologists from from all around the globe. I learned that not only IT Security folks but all of the technologists that we interact with have commonalities in their problems and resolutions, that need to be measured and documented for costs savings and repeat-ability. Such fun!",5

Real Estate and Design Assistant,This job taught me a lot about the legal ins and outs of building in other state. I was able to travel and learn a lot about real estate and design. I enjoyed this job however I was along way from my family,4
Great Place to work with great management.,I enjoy working for the company. My management is very fair and listens to what you have to say and values your input. The job is very high stress but will keep you interested.,5
Walmart Career.,"Walmart provides the ability for individuals to advance their career within the company.  Many Associates including myself have accomplished this based on their work ethic, their ability to adapt and change based on the company's needs.",4
Don't Believe HR,dead culture; management only cares about themselves; good 'ole boy network; can't get a promotion unless you know someone; working hard gets you nowhere; everyone fears for their job on a regular basis - NO job security,2
Lots of different types of opportunities,Walmart offers a lot of different opportunities and has about any position you can think of within the IT field. They have a very relaxed environment to work.,5
Healthy stable work,"Great work environment advancement is hard to come by but completely possible with hard work and dedication. Good benefits, paid time off etc. always learning something new and the company loves teaching their employees have training classes e",5
Good,"A stable company to wok for. Good environment. Friendly co-worker. Good working conditions. Workers reap social, health and personal benefits from a positive atmosphere at the company",4

Excellent job opportunities with that Company,"Working for the private fleet division was fast paced, never knowing what may happen with that many drivers on the road.  One has to be very detailed oriented and flexible to maintain the files and the calls that came through daily. The management team was always very supportive when their help was needed. It was a fun place to work, not to mention we had great team players that worked very well together.",5
Gbs,"Same as the other review. It is a good place to work. Benefits are good. The associates are the best part of working for GBS. Culture is good not as close to what Sam would want to it is not completely lost, yet,",4
WalMart,I can't say anymore then I did in the other review. Please refenece back to that review. The Call Center is a tough place to work. I admire the agents that work there.,4
Excellent company for growth and development,"Walmart provides an excellent opportunity for anyone with any background to grow, develop and achieve.

Walmart Home Office is a decent place to work at.,"Overall, my experience with Walmart has been a good one. I've been treated fairly, and I like that my hours can fluctuate. The only issue I have is that they seem to only want to place you where they want you, and it doesn't always matter what you want.",3
My opinion is nuetral. Fun place if you are in the right team.,"Typical day is like working for other corporate america corporation where you are required to work but for more than regular 8 hour work day. If you are in the right group, you could learn very much since technology is not an issue. There is this mentor system that translates to how you know. The hardest part is the company's over reliant on vendors to perform the work while direct employees do less that will develop their skill sets. Being in the right group/team that uses new technology stack is always enjoyable.",3
Good company to work for,"Good company to work for, grea culture, good work family life balance.  Good Peer to Peer interaction, supportive management. Strong culture to embrace change and growth.",4

Great place to work,I have enjoyed a 24+ year career at Wal-Mart with opportunity to make an impact in a number of areas of the business.  Challenges are always present and opportunity for advancement is available.,4
Typical day at work,Always changing and fast paced. This helps make the day go by faster and gives you a felling of accomplishment. We work as a team to meet category goals.,4
Life at Walmart,"Typical day at work starts with checking emails and anything Supervisor has left for me to do.  I booked travel both in US and International for a team of 35 and work their expense vouchers.Helped with Shareholders for our International associates.  I learned to be flexible, adaptable, and open to change.  Moving up was always an option at Walmart if you desired.  The hardest part of the job was stress that went with getting work done in a time frame.  Enjoyable part of job was working with the team.",5
Walmart,I enjoyed my time at Walmart.  The teams that I worked with felt more like family than corporate America.  The best part of every day was watching how the business continued to grow so that we could continue to save people money so that they could live better.,3

Great environemnet for growth,Personally believe that some of the best Walmart associates at corporate level have experience in the field or stores directly. This experience provided me knowledge in stgore opperations and customer service that is hard to achieve without a hands on approach.,5
Great Company,Lot's of room for growth. True dedication to Walmart culture. Would recommend for anyone trying to graduate into a more professional corporate environment.,5
Great company to build experience.,Walmart is a great company to build experience and enhance skill sets difficult to achieve outside of the workplace.Multiple opportunities and tools to grow professionally and personally.,5

Walmart is the finest company in the world.,"Worked in the community yearly to support 'in need' non-profits; I learned more from Walmart than from any other company. Walmart is the finest company to work for.  No discrimination.",5
Great company but at inflection point,"Fragmented, siloed, amazingly smart people but little direction and too execution focused to be forward thinking   great company but stay away for few years if you are in it or hr",4
working with cad designs,"I review blueprints on special projects that walmart corp has planned for the year.  i balance a work load of approx 250 projects corresponding with field associates, suppliers and program managers to insure the right items get ordered for the project. Hardest part of the job would be to ensure that our suppliers and truck lines are delivering on time. Most enjoyable, its a challenge ever changing and keeps you on your toes.",4
Would never work at again,"It's Wal-Mart.  They want everything and give nothing in return.  Sure, there will always be a few cases of people who were given promotions early, thus it makes them complacent.  Most managers who seem ""cool"" eventually buckle under the pressure from upper management and turn against the associates they manage.",1
"Great people, and good job if you are in the right spot.","I loved the work and my coworkers.  Way too stressful for the pittance I got.  You were held responsible for EVERYTHING that ever happened. If you come in to the company the right way, you'll be set.  If not, you will be miserable.  Do your homework first!",2
The Best,"A great employer. Everyday is fun and exciting. Benefits are the best in the country, and the opportunities are limitless. I recommend that everyone applies for a career at walmart",5
Decent company,"Mostly a good experience, though layoffs are becoming more prevalent. Company does a lot of good. They seem to be losing focus on their bread and butter, which is retail. Seem intent on dominating other markets that aren't particularly necessary.",4
Great culture to work in,"The culture is great to be a part of The company is always striving to be betterThe work/life balance is typically pretty goodThe career opportunities are extensive",4
horrible leadership,Horrible leadership at Home office in Bentonville.  Lots of nepotism at all levels.  Need help bridging the gaps.  Inconsistent practices across the organization.,4
Great experience being able to learn from colleagues around the world.,A mostly serious workplace but it is obvious that you are valued as an individual. The environment of work is high pressure/high reward. You have a real chance to make a difference in the business.,4
Good place to work,Strong culture. Good people. Good exposure to multiple domains. Get to work on multiple tools and applications. Management is encouraging and accommodating.,4
No longer a sure thing,"Walmart is no longer a sure thing. The company is too big, too bureaucratic, too conservative, and too stubborn to make the changes it needs to survive.",3
Agile Scrum Master,Facilitating daily stand up scrum meetings with my team. Coordinate Agile ceremonies on a weekly basis.  Open door and great associates. Working in Wal- Marts Point Of Sale in their ID Department is full of action and requires on your feet thinking. If you want cut it here you can work anywhere.,4
Awesome place to work!!!,A great place to retire from!! Brand new equipment every 4 years!!  New tractor.   You really just have to drive. And be safe!!  Couldn't ask for a better place to work for,5
Competitive working environment,"A typical working day, taking care of Business requirements related to ongoing Projects.  I have learned and skilled myself in different IT Technologies while at Walmart.Management - no comments.Workplace culture is friendly and open.Fulfilling the needs of the customer, Business Partners was the most enjoyable, delivering them the end products.",3
Fun work environment but stressful job changes,"I enjoyed working here, the people were fun and enjoyable to be around, but it was a stressful work environment at times. Leadership changed often, and then the roles changed along with it, many people felt unknowledgeable in their roles. The pay was not enough for what was required of the job duties.",3
Not enough hours in a day to do the work needed.,Work you like a dog and then lay off a bunch of people in January. Very high expectations but not near enough time in the day to get the work done.  They talk a lot about work/life balance but it's all talk.,3
Good place to work,It's a good place to work. The work vs life balance is good for the family man. If you want to move up you can with Wal-Mart. They have multiple choices there for a career.,4
N/a,enjoy working for the company there's room for advancement within the company. You need to know where you want to go and what you want to do within your career.,4
overview,"Productive work environment where I established specific supply chain metrics for various categories within Walmart Grocery business.  Cross function teams were challenging yet rewarding and areas where I learned the most.Global Procurement was a challenging area where we relied heavily on consistent weather patterns in order to flow needed amounts of inventory to all of our US Stores.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
High Stress and Cut-throatt Environment,A typical day is about 10 hours with very little work life balance.  There seems to be no security and trust in the workplace. People with many years and experience let go.,3
"Walmart provided me so many opportunities,","Walmart provided me so many opportunities, from merchandising to  benefits. I was fortunate to have great leadership that embraced the Walmart culture, endless learning opportunities, great benefits, and a strong 401(k).  The most enjoyable part of my experience with Walmart was taking care of our associates and customers.  The most difficult and stressful is the continual reduction in staffing with no forethought of how the day to day business would be handled. The end result was undoubtedly doing more with less.",4
Work,"Each day has variation. There (to me) is not a thing such as ""a typical day"". One day, you may be tasks with doing the job of others along with yours. On another day, you may be able to focus on your specific routine. At times, expectations are unrealistic and the home office is very out of touch with daily store operations. Overall, the potential the company has is promising, however, there are several people in the wrong positions.",4
"Worked at the downtown neighborhood market, and i can say it wasnt the best place to work.","Wal-Mart is very strict with point systems and give you coachings for stupid reasons. The environment wasn't what I was told. Some of the staff weren't nice people. And some of them start drama, which affected the work place.",2
Challenging and rewarding,I used critical thinking skills to review and analyze incoming complaints/reports.  Empowered to do Ethics Opinions involving things like Conflict of Interest.,5
Stable and happy work environment,"A typical day at work:  Collaboration with othersWhat I learned:  teams win, individuals don'tManagement:  supervisor who will help me develop in a professional mannerworkplace culture:  family like culturehardest part of the job:  the is not hard job, there are opportunitiesmost enjoyable part of the job:",4
"Much potential, constant changing of the guard","Sam's Club and Walmart both offer so much more that just a paycheck. They do pay well compared to the industry, but it's their additional benefits that go unappreciated. Volunteerism Always Pays (VAP) pays organization when employee volunteer their time. Great for scout troops and local organizations within the community. Saturday morning meetings, may sound intrusive, but it's a great time and very entertaining with a constant stream of well known guest, and an opportunity for the leaders to show their human side. Great open door culture all the way up to the top. Tremendous community involvement that makes their home town of Bentonville a true treasure that most people would never realize.  With any company, numbers and leadership changes drives decisions, sometimes much more frequently than it should.",4
"Fun job, good coworkers",Interesting job for someone just starting out. Provides experience in material handling. Interesting to distribution end of the supply chain. Very low pay.,1
"Best company to work for based on the people, culture and strive to save people money so they could live better.",Every workday was very fast paced and challenging. Always given the opportunity to continuously lean the industry and improve the business through new technology and process improvements. The management team is seriously honest and genuine. The workplace culture is great in that it creates a very comfortable environment. The hardest part of he job was that it was a 24/7/365 operation and a constant thought. The most enjoyable was working with a lot of people that were very kind and dedicated to the business.,5
"Great Company, Great Culture","Walmart gives you so many opportunities to grow and advance. They really emphasize the importance of team work, character and integrity. If there is ever a problem you know you can talk to someone and be heard.",4
Good Place to start your career,"Generally good culture, but the desire to move quickly and catch up with competitors is forcing a lot of change and layoffs.  No long term job security anymore.",3
ok,worked extensively in the operations area; worked as a scrum master for the walmart transportation management system; implemented operations in multiple areas with onsite offshore model,4
Ambitious company with focus on short-term goals while sacrificing long-term gains,"Great culture and priniciples but slightly outdated to current strategic direction. Highly tactical approach where long term strategies are recently being considered but haven't fleshed out. Too much focus on what's competition doing rather than addressing customers and their needs.Strong collaboration among cross functional teams that can also lead to political turbulance. Seasoned people are set in their way of working with old fashion thinking and this is partly due to being located in a bubble, small town, out of touch with rest of the world.",3
Great Company,Walmart was a great company to work with. We both had a passion for customer service and treating people with respect. Walmart treating me and my family well and I did the same to the Walmart family.,5
Fun workplace always playing music,I loved working at walmart i got to laugh and joke with friends while getting the job done. Always played music old and new music. The benefits were reallt good.,4
"Fast-paced, challenging and exciting place to work",Good company with interesting and challenging work.  High caliber people.  Company provides many opportunities for growth and learning.  Demanding work and size and scale of company results in one never running out of high priority work initiatives.,4
Fun Workplace,The culture at Walmart is extremely collaborative and it makes for an exciting day. You will always learn something new and really enjoyed working for Walmart.,5
Family orientated work place,"Walmart warehouse was a easy place to work, very many caring people at the work place. Very rewarding on service pins, the place makes you feel important.",4
Unethical,"They have mandatory 45 hour weeks, attendance policy is unrealistic and they fire people unethically. Pay is good for what I do but overall, most people here are looking for a new job with another company.",1
Productive and beneficial learning experience,"Great place to work as a permanent associate, but not as a temporary associate.  There are no benefits until you have worked with the company for a year to an exception of the discount card.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Great company.,"Great company, many opportunities for advancement. I would still be there if I hadn't moved out of the area.  Gave performance reviews and chances for raises.",4
Peaceful City,My experience as a consultant at Walmart might be different than the Walmart Associates. As a consultant data scientist I was more focused on doing modeling.,5
challenging with good compensation,"It is challenging work environment with long work hours. it has  great compensation packages, including annual bonuses.  self motivated training programs.",3
Positive Culture and Environment,A strong culture and good management provide a positive and healthy environment. Great place to start a career. Growth opportunities are plentiful but acquiring positions is very competitive.,4
Walmart disputes resolution,The people are great! I enjoy working for this company and feel if you put 100% into your work you will advance in your career in no time. The culture of the company has changed since the days of Mr.Sam but I believe the company has to change with the changing times.,4
6 years,I worked there for 6 years. Unfortunately I was part of a large business decision and was included in a company wide layoff in January. I enjoyed my time with the company and all my co workers.,5

Walmart,"Good and professional environment.Good peopleClean and nice working environmentFull Time workLearned time management, multitasking",5
An Experience,"Working at the company gave me the opportunity to learn my craft well and to help the everyday consumer. It's a great company for anyone looking for a start. However, I would not advise anyone to stay with them long-term as work/life balance will continue to remain an issue. From experience, there's the culture the company thinks it portrays and then there's the real side of it. On the bright side, you feel an attachment to the work you do because deep down you know that it helps the person in the store to do their job which trickles down to benefiting the customer. Yet, unrealistic expectations from direct supervisors ruins the morale of the associate despite giving them feedback.",3
Fun place to work,Learned a lot about business.  Was able to work as a team.  Management was good.  Hardest part was the complexity of the items.  The best part was the people.,4
Great place to work and grow.,A typical day at work is finding exceptions and solving problems.  I learned a lot about being professional and managing a business.  Management was always helpful and laid back.   The culture is great and very friendly.  The hardest part of the job finding time to finish everything you would like to get done.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  They are always willing to help and guide you.,4
Stepping Stone,"The Walmart Home Office is not the place any designer wants to be. I learned quite a lot as far as the retail business goes, but Walmart is not a place for a designer. The pay was terrible, the office was dark and dirty, the equipment was 5 years old or older, the software was not up to date. I had to work on my own personal computer most of the time just to get my work done. Plus, they expected me to work on average of 65+ hours a week. There's absolutely no job security within Walmart.",2
Was Ok to work for.,Liked my job but found out it's a very cut throat atmosphere a little too late.  Constant layoffs to hire entry level people at lower wages.,3
no loyalty,"pay is reasonable to the work required. Training is something you have to seek out. Management is there for themselves and more than willing to throw you under the bus to save themselves. Culture was great 10 to 15 years ago when I 1st started slowly loosing that culture. hardest part of the job was getting up in the morning knowing you you were heading in to bust your rump and received little to no gratitude or respect. Veterans beware, Walmart's hire a Vet initiative is a PR stunt to make them look better to the public. yes they will hire you but that's as far as it goes. There is nothing they do to retain you. Take it from a Vet that worked for Walmart for 15 years with little to no growth (and I promise you its not because i didn't grow). You better know someone or be related to someone to get anywhere with this company",2
N/a,"Good company to work for and very supportive of work/life balance.  Great benefits and lots of room for growth and advancement.",4
I worked at one of the vendors for Walmart,"More pay is deservedEmployees don't like vendors who can think and perform their job in a managerial style that is better and more effective than them. Jealousy predominant and needs to be curtailed",3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Great Culture. Fast Pace,"Love working here. Culture is great. Will work you as hard as you allow them to. Company focus shift to eCommerce operations and technology advances. Great opportunity to learn at the fortune 1 company.  Bentonville is extremely family oriented. If you are single and young, may not be a great fit.",4
Losing its culture and respect for associates,"For employees at HQ, recently implemented a rule where you have to stay in a position for at least three years. This rule is very contrary to the way people work today. Executives came up with the policy saying it is good for our career. Fortunately, for them, they didn't have to follow the policy to get where they are. Now that they are at the top, they don't mind enforcing the rule on others. Additionally, they are asking for more work time from associates. Walmart has always been known for working a decent amount of hours, but still allowed enough time for a person to have a life. This is slipping away with more expectations of working 10-11 hours a day and working through lunch.",3
Great people.,I was lucky to have a position doing meaningful work. My work was flexible and I worked with really great people who cared about our associates.,4
Wonderful place to work,I enjoyed working for Walmart and I have no complaints.  Work and life balance were great.  I would work for them again.  Typing and filing.,5
Stable company,"Walmart can provide a stable atmosphere and career development opportunities. There are many places to go within Walmart, no matter what you want to do, you can do it at Walmart.",4
Good Classes,It is hard to make difference in that company unless personally you know somebody high up. I do like that they invested in different training classes for their employees.,4
"Good, stable place to work","I enjoy working at Walmart.  It is a good place to work, and I recommend it.  You can start, build, and complete a good career here.  It is very demanding though, and can often be quite stressful.",4
Productive and fun workplace,Productive workplace with very dedicated employees.  Strong culture and many long-term associates.  Very large company with many moving pieces.,4
Traveling,Traveling is a major part of the job and it can interfear with the family life. Supervision is a problem because it changes from one day to the next. The best part is the peolpe.,4
Mediocre,"The company has a rich history, but is struggling to find a way to compete with Amazon. The infrastructure in Bentonville is outdated--making it a bore to work there.",3
Senior Recruiter,"Recruited management associates for Merchandising, Product Development, Planning, Replenishment, Marketing, Corporate Affairs, Direct Imports, Real Estate, Legal, and e-Commerce Divisions.   Wrote job descriptions and sourced talent within the industry utilizing effect networking techniques.   Developed and implemented recruiting strategies, interviewed, and negotiated offers that resulted in the placement of over 1000 talented and successful managers in the Corporate Headquarters.",3
Walmart Stores,"Work is hard, hours can be long, challenges are great.  Ensuring the associates are happy, have the tools they need to accomplish their daily tasks, have a strong and healthy environment to work in and a management team that cares about their success is vitally important to the success of the company.",3
Strict Work Environment,"I enjoy working for Walmart; that is, when it seems that managers are competent (of which I've had many) but not when you feel that you have to do their job (of which I've had a few as well). Overall it's a very professional environment where you can move up with hard work, good presentation, and a degree.",3
Compliance Driven,A typical day at work would consist of making sure all licenses are current. When new pharmacies open insure all licenses are applied for and received in a timely manner for grand opening. The most important part of the job was creating relationships with agencies. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the team mates and working together to get job accomplished.,4
"Great culture, diverse workforce","There is no ""typical"" day, focus and needs change quickly.  This is a highly diverse company that gives you exposure to many types of people and business areas.",3
Not applicable,I prefer not to discuss such matters unless there is a specific question that is being addressed. An answer can be provided at a later time.,1
fine,I punched in. I put carts away. I cleaned the store. I mined my own bussiness. Just work hard and show up to work on time you should be fine. Its the easiest job ever.,4
Associate Driven,You can grow at Walmart.  Choose HO opportunities and the sky is the limit. Store opportunities provide a springboard to corporate jobs. The culture of the organization is steeped in history and strives to do its best by associates.,4
WM Logistics,"Ours is a fast paced environment where we balance results with relationships with the common goal of giving our customers the right product at the right price.  We do not compromise our values of integrity, excellence, service, or respect as we maximize our value to all stakeholders.

Review of Work,"Good sense of community and volunteerismGreat Green InitiativesLeadership lacks managementNo room for career advancementRampant with nepotism and favortism",2
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Place for growth,Walmart is a great place to learn new skills sets and grow so that you may advance in your career. You are challenged everyday working for this retail giant. A typcial day in the office is not expecting not to learn anything new. An open mind is needed daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is reaching goals. Whether you set personal goals for your daily tasks or your leadership provides goals to you. Reaching them and actually seeing yourself make a difference is the most rewarding.,5

"New and diverse learning, Ever changing",The oppurtunity to work in veriouse work environments with diverse working conditions. I learned to keep my leading style flexible to aid in growin the team.

"Very time consuming, and not a lot of off days.","Overall it was okay, but there could definitely be better management. Another goood thing is there were a lot of people and very large work spaces. I also had two offices so i always got a lot of exercise.",2
Great place to start career,"Through the program managers were very hands on and interns were provided with essential tools to succeed in a corporate work environment. Open door policy was great and a huge plus. Work/Life balance was great.",4
Unique and demanding culture,"Walmart has a unique culture compared to most of corporate America. It is very conservative and cost-conscious.  As the world's largest company, once inside, there is tremendous opportunity to learn all aspects of the business.",3
This was an awful company to work for.,They had no consideration for the fact the associates had lives outside of work you were not allowed to make arrangements for appointments or family requirements,1
"A great lace to work, even better people",I have enjoyed my time at Walmart. The people are fantastic and supportive. The work is exactly as its advertised and thwe manaegment is exceptional. Really a great place to work,5
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Productive and easy going workplace that encouraged a friendly environment to all associates and customers.,"I would come in every morning and go through all of produce and make sure nothing was out of date or rotten.  Then I would go to the back and load up a cart of what we needed out on the floor and go stock it.  After I got the floor up and running I would then go to the back and down stack the produce truck into the steel where it belongs.I learned how to work hard and comply to all customer needs.The managers were friendly and easy to work with.The hardest part would be dealing with unruly customers.The most enjoyable part of my job was when a customer would ask me to help them find something and I would help them and they would be very thankful.  It would just make my day every time.",4
Company has a great culture,They always encourage you to speak your mind and escalate issues. Concerns are heard when they are voiced to the right person.,5
"Professional Environment but no job security, good benefits","Culture is on the right track, but you never know when you will be part of a reorg.  Professional environment with people who act like adults.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you get to work with and come to know.",3
Strong Company,Walmart is a strong company which is head on challenging Amazon for the dominant position in retail.  I enjoyed my tenure there.,5
Can be stressful at times but the people are great,"Work with internal and external customers to solve complex problems and drive inefficiencies.  I feel like most associates in management are transparent and give honest feedback.  Like anywhere else, there are some that do not.  My overall experience was great.",4
productive work place,I learned a lot both personally and professionally. It all depend on your point of you when you begin working. Everyones' experience will be different,4
Very enjoyable work space!,It was very enjoyable being a building specialist. I learned about time management in the work space. Having a night shift I feel as though I cant give you an accurate review. But the night shift was difficult as I had never done a night shift before. I don't think I would ever enjoy doing that again with school and a social life.,4
Great place to work and promote,Great company to start a career and gain experience. Top leadership all around and people oriented. Only reason I left was to start my own business.,5

Great place to work. I've made a long term career out of working at Walmart and love it here. Love the culture and people.,"I love working at Walmart. I am seeking additional work outside my regular full time job as my family needs more than what I can support with my current job.I would recommend Walmart to anyone seeking a job.It has been there for me and my family for over 17 years.",5
Average-to-good workplace,"This is a great place to work as long as you do whatever they ask of you. Any time you say no hurts your prospects, even if it isn't something in your job code. The pay is okay but not great. Advancement is a possibility if you can stick it out long enough. Having said that, great work/life balance, good insurance, fantastic coworkers, and in my experience they stick to it when they promote their sharing ideas and open door policies.",3
"Work hard, play harder","Working at the Walmart Home Office, as a designer, I was required to crank out work quickly and efficiently. The design team was held to a high standard. We didn't just have one design head to please, but several high up marketing managers as well. We needed to wow them by coming up with new and inventive designs while still staying on-point to Walmart's brand standards. When we weren't designing, we were out on team building events or in group discussions talking about design trends and inventing new ways to build signing elements to wow not only the marketing managers of Walmart, but also the shoppers, our customers. It was fast-paced, labor-intensive, detail-oriented, and fun. The team always had each other's back and were willing to help one another with workload. Our motto was always ""Work hard, play harder"" and that's exactly what we tried to accomplish every day.",4
Looking For Other Opportunities,"Working on-site at Walmart has not been the best of experiences. I have learned a lot about corporate campaigns, but the Marketing processes are not concrete and it is difficult to work with some marketers and their Operations team.",3
Interesting Work Place,"Walmart is a good company to work for however, recent events and shifts within the company makes one feel as if job security is very uncertain.",4

Great company with decent compensation and benefits,"It's great place to start and develop your career, as well as to settle in until retirement.  Compensation & benefits packages are competitive. The area is also great for families or those looking to start a family.",5
Very corporate,little to no freedom during the workday (given that this particular time of the year is extremely busy) closely monitored on productivity.,3
Great,They care about there employees and have great benefits. They also care about your well being and treat you as a valued person. They offer incentives for better your personal life.,5
Good place to work with contractors,I was worked on 14 different Walmart stores across several counties. I was in charge of getting contractors and vendors to come in and go warranty jobs and things that I was not allowed by company policy to work on.,2
Productive work environment,"I worked for Walmart for almost 8 years, and had it not been for the death of my husband, I would still be employed with Walmart. Although there were issues with certain aspects of the job and even a few of the new managers that seemed to quickly forget where they started from, it is basically a very good company to work for.  The issues Iran into, were no different than what a person would or might deal with at any job.",5
Family Oriented,Good place to work but could use more advancement opportunities for their current employees.  Too much emphasis is put on a college degree rather than retail experience with the company as a whole.,5
Hardwork great enviroment,"I love the jewelry warehouse 6051. The management is absolutely on point with the Sam Walton culture!  I have had the best manger by far at this D.C . My coworkers are insanely helpful an friendly.This job for me personally is very stressful, A high production to meet working on 3rd shift can be intense.",5
Dirty and Cheap,Walmart is a great company to work for as long as you are an hourly employee. Managers are not treated fairly or with any respect. Job security for management does not exist.,1
Hard Work for Reasonable pay,"Typical day starts at 5:00am until 5:30pm varies for different shifts. It is not climate controlled. You get dirty,Sweaty and very tired.I learned that if you take care of your people they will take care of you.Management is all about the company and hitting the desired numbers. The co-workers are generally caring individuals that are bound to doing what it takes to be successful for the company.Hardest part of the job was terminating good associates that made bad business decisions.The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching people how to be successful in a fast paced environment.",4
Productive fast pace work enviornment,"Great MentorsGrowth opportunitiesStrong focus on customerLong work hours.  Must be able to manage your time for work/life balance.",3
How I grew up in retail,"17 years with the company and learned a lot as WalMart invested a lot of time in leadership, retail and overall people. As with any company and transitions, sometime culture from corporate leadership is uncertain. But overall good experience and with the initiative anyone can be successful.",4
Love the job,Great place to work. Made great money and the schedule was flexible. I also had a great management team that worked with me more than what they really had to.,5
Hard working place with little care for associates,You are basically there for one job and you need to expect to hurt. Its a great job for anyone who can handle pain and work fast.,3

Interesting,"Different IT environment. I really do not feel comfortable rating a place in which I currently work. Therefore, I respectfully decline to do so at this time.",3

Insurance could be better,"We should be fully covered by the company with minimal out of pocket to no out of pocket. Walmart should pay 100% of all insurance. If we could get away with only paying $16 a pay period for full coverage, that would be idea.",5
hours demanding  lost much of sams values,"hours were availble 24-7 if needed.enjoyed most associates and customers.when iwas there bonus package for manager same as associates,understand this has changed",4
"Great Start, Fast Paced, Customer Service Driven","This is a great place to start a career within the company. Every job/career has it's pros and cons. There is no job work/life balance. The schedule is always iffy it is subject to change any time the business see's fit so if you make plans to spend time with your family that probably won't happen. You hardly ever get two consecutive days off in a row so the days off aren't really enjoyable. You are always open 7 days a week until 9:00 o'clock and you work most major holidays so a lot of time is spent working rather than getting to enjoy family. You spend a lot of time getting screamed at and cussed out by customers and management is not really empathetic about the situation because they are not taking the phone calls. Also they hire outside supervisors instead of promoting within so you play second fiddle to someone who has never stepped foot in your department until they are hired and you train your supervisor so it easily upsets you because you feel you are not good enough. Besides that the company does try to work to make sure we do have days that are unlike any other employer . We do have days set aside to do something special such as nacho day, chili day, crazy sock day, costumes on Halloween, etc.There are all staff meeting where associates are acknowledged for hard work and dedication and there is plenty of opportunity to advance within the company. You also get PTO.",3
a great place,The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to all the customers and getting to know them. Once you have a connection they'll continue to come back as regulars and when you have nice people your whole shift it makes it easier.,5
fun,"learned team supportmanagement was goodco-workers were very helpfulthe team lunch party was enjoyable partgood environment",5
Provided valuable work experience.,"After 10 years with the company I have experienced a lot of ups and downs.  I have had supervisors and managers that were great to work with and taught me many things.  I also had some that were at times unfair, difficult, and only interested in advancing their own careers.  I also had the privilege of supervising and managing many outstanding and dedicated associates.",3
"Good people, bad management",Good people in the company. But management in Walmart technology is filled with people who don't understand technology. Technology decisions are taken by people who know nothing about technology. They trust vendors more than their own employees.,3
Wonderful Experience and Career,I love working for this company. I have been able to experience and learn from amazing people as well as be exposed to many different department within the business.,5
Great Opportunity to Improve yourself,"A lot of advancement opportunities are available, for example, I took the leadership training classes for one week to advance my management skills, and etc.",4
Nil,Walmart information service division is a place where you can learn so many new things .All the colleagues are so helpful and motivating .Its a good place to work.,4

Legal department that handled all retail issues,Great place to work. Loved all the work that I handled. Learned many aspects of the legal field. Learned great skills in negotiation. Discount for retail stores within the United States.,5
Director,Best experience as a Leader in Walmart. I loved working with the people and the hardest part was to manage the work life balance as the work was very exciting working with awesome teams and learning to grow.,5
Tax Department Needs Work,The individual in the tax department at the Wal-Mart home office are underpaid and under appreciated.  The management group has no insight on how to develop people.,3
Productive and Good Company,"Work kept you busy especially during the holidays. Only downfall was when it got slow the company made some employees take a temporary layoff, but you were able to draw unemployment for the lost hours.",4
Great group of people to work with including access to great mentors and all levels of leadership,Walmart is a very fast-paced environment of constant change.  It is a great place to work for those who are excited about change and want to be a part of it.  It is a great place to grow your career for the highly driven individual.,4
Productive and fun place to work.,When I got there I would go to the front and find a customer service manager to get my assigned cash register or they would give me a project that needed to be done. My co-workers worked very well together and helped each other when needed. The hardest part of my job would be standing for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of my job would be being able to talk to customers as well as everyone being able to get along and working effectively.,5
Loved Wal-Mart,I loved the relationships I made working at Wal-Mart. I would have never left Wal-Mart but I needed to pursue other opportunities. Wal-Mart takes very good care of their associates,5
Its a great company to work for,"The daily works jobs depends on your attitude.If your welling to learn and you have a go getter attitude you can grow your knowledge.managers are good co workers depends on mine was really good love working side by side with them the hardest part about it,is that you really have to watch what you have to say because once again your sr manager will hold your head under water and  let you breath for a sec. If you know what I mean. The hardest thing about the job is not trying and to finished on a good notes what I enjoy about working there was when your on a construction project be there from start to finished and the New look of the area it's an amazing thing just knowing that you were a big part of it :)",3
it was fun and challenging,you always was busy because the calls would constantly be coming in but they always made popcorn and brought snacks to your desk.,4
high turnover,"I was one of the only employees to make it even a year there. I was scheduled to work anywhere between 5:00 am to 10:00pm and usually 6 days a week. I wasn't allowed to work more than 32 hrs, so I was often scheduled for several 4 or 6 hr shifts.",1
Great exposure to the company as a whole,Great exposure but limited areas to advance into. Have to leave area to advance. But great training and career builder.,4
Productive,able to make a large difference in a team environment.  Lots of red tape to go through to get things done.  This is typical of many large companies but can be frustrating when you want to move fast.,3
Very Busy,It was very busy. Taking lunch breaks created hardship on other pharmacist. Pharmacist felt guilty if they took a break.,3
Love Walmart,I enjoyed working at Walmart and will go back anytime. The people that I worked with were great. Best Co-workers. I had a great team of direct reports working for me.,4
A cult is what it is,"They don't hire temporary workers based on experience but on stupid irrelevant interview questions. Being interview by people you won't work for is bias also. You show your skills and still don't get hired. It's a cult based environment not a culture! If you're not from Bentonville, Ar do not come! Traffic is the worst getting to work also!",1
Learned a lot,Learned a lot.  Able to do some international travel.  Nice people.  Con - very cheap.  Great access to senior management.  Very smart people.  Compensation is competetive.  I really enjoyed working with the people there.  They are a joy to work with.,4
Fun and Learning Environment,Workplace at Walmart is Productive and fun-filled. Relationship between management and team is good. Work and Office timings are flexible. We get good support from co-workers as well,5
Exciting and Knowledgable,So many opportunities to grow and experience new positions within this company. There are always positions available in several different areas within the company.,5
Good teamwork and management put customers first.,The Bentonville store was ran very well. Everyone work closely together were always happy. Most of our customers were frequent and loved going to the store. Our managers always took care of employees and customer and the store was extremely well kept. However the Neosho store i went to afterwards wasnt as good.  The teamwork between associates was good but the store to me didnt seem to run like it should. Customer Service was good but compared to Bentonville i felt alot of it missing.,4
Everyday is a new experience,"Had fun almost everyday, people were very easy to develop. Problem solving was very enjoyable. promoting hourly associates to management was so fulfilling.",4
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3

Great experience working at Wal-Mart,"The team is adapting new technologies and I have learned many new technologies while working here. They will give lot of priority and support to our ideas.",4
"650,000 sq ft Distribution Center which feeds other DCs and Stores","As an intake/inventory control clerk (slotter) the pace is very fast, typically handling 4-5 unload doors at a time with 2 unloaders in each door.  There is little to no room for error as the functionality of all aspects of the warehouse rests solely on your shoulders.  The Traffic Office aspect of my job is very fast paced as well with 75-100 trucks inbound on a slow week with 2500+/- on each truck and a dozen carrier companies, each with their own style of doing things.  It is fun and challenging every day and you never run out of things to learn. Management is touch and go as there are 60 or so managers in the  building which I work in and they each have their own management style.",4
Great culture and good work/life balance,Excellent place to work to help others.  Excellent benefits and fellow associates.  Great opportunities for advancement and personalized professional development offered.,5
Take it or leave it,"lot of red tapes, deal will managment and get what you need . Else stay frustrated. Benefits are not that great either, also limits you on your investments.",1
No room for boredom here.,"Constantly changing environment.   There is opportunities in any field you are interested in.   Each and every day bring something new and probably unexpected.   For good or bad, you will never be bored.",4
Productive workplace with a friendly atmosphere,Many details cannot be disclosed due to the nature of the Privacy and Compliance Office.  Most of the work that I did dealt with legislation.,5
Mature workplace with Legos,"Great hoursFriendly team membersFantastic area North West ArkansasChallenging but ecstatic environment Great healthcareAlways learning something new everyday",4
Good Company,"Overall Walmart is a good company to work for. Associates work hard, and you build a lifetime of friendships with them. Benefits are good as well and offer something for everyone.",4
Don't do it unless you have to,"I would NOT recommend working here. Wal-mart itself is a great company, but this particular facility is TERRIBLE. They will draw you in with it being a foot in the door at Home Office, then refuse to promote you after hitting your year. Management is not to be trusted and they do not care about their jobs. They will micromanage you fire you just because they don't like you and give you no notice. The compliance and ethics are ridiculous and so detailed that they are impossible to follow. This is the most corrupted place I've ever worked for. DO NOT WORK HERE.",2
walmart work environment,"...constant mid-level management churn, over-the-shoulder work ethic...upper level management on a remove-and-replace tear...",2
Good Place to work if you Have Management Supporting You,"Good Place to work if you Have Management Supporting You The reason I have the above as my summary is because when I worked for Walmart, I experienced threats from another co-worker, which management didn't take seriously.  Why is it that you feel should have to quit because the ""Open Door Process"" doesn't work?     As far as ""work-life balance"" goes, there is none.   As far as job security/advancement goes, I didn't receive the same level of training that others before me and after me.  Of course, management attempted to rectify this by re-training me, but then when I had a choice of which team to go to when they got rid of print services on the Field Support side, I asked if I could go back to the Pharmacy Team.  Obviously, a lot had changed. Overall, they don't take their basic beliefs seriously, especially when it comes to ""Respect for the Individual.""",4
Love the company culture and its focus on the customer,Walmart provides the best environment for its associates to grow professionally and personally. I have learnt a lot in my 20 year career with Walmart.We were trained to treat people fairly and with respect. Walmart empowers its associates so that we are comfortable making  several critical decisions for the business.,3
Overall Walmart is a good Company to work for,I never had a typical day due do supervision of people. I learned a lot while employed there.  Most of my comments are on the other review I just completed.,4
Over all Walmart was a great company to work for,I never had a typical day at work when supervising associates. I learned how to get along with several types of personalities and learned how to be a fair manager. The hardest part of the job was coaching people for success as well has having to let someone go. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and getting to know so many of the associates. Another enjoyable part was being able to do a little travel including getting to go to Puerto Rico to help transition part of the accounts receivables to the Walmart Corp. office.,5
office,It is a great place to work. Family is important to everyone. your co workers become your second family. management wants to hear what you have to say and if you see a different way to do a process they will listen to you about it.,5
Great Corporate Culture,"The people I worked with is what made going into the office so much fun.  I can't speak for other departments however in Real Estate, everyone, top down seemed well-grounded & willing to help regardless of their title.",4
Fun working and learned a lot while working,Got production issue with MFTP aplication that was very critical application but we worked together to resolve that as a team till 12:30 am.I really likes a lot that day.,5

Great Place to work,"Great place to work. Management encourages you on a daily basis. Great mentorship program, job shadow, classes. Training is always available to advance in certain jobs. Great people to work with and work for.",4
This company lives by the code of respect for the individual.,"The ethical standards are second to none in the business world.There is no limit to what an individual can do at Walmart if you are willing to try.  The company gives you freedom to try new things, does not demean failure. Listens to ideas of others.  The atmosphere at the office is upbeat and focused. Management is always willing to partner with you to overcome obstacles. I have learned what teamwork really means and how cross functional teams should really work.The most interesting part of the job is putting the scale of Walmart into perspective relative to other businesses. Nearly a half a trillion dollars per year revenue is staggering. They have categories of product (Coffee e.g) that does more business than most entire food companies.",5
"Trend setters, friendly and family oriented","I started with US Vision when they were introducing a new brand ( Macy Optical Boutique) in the Market.  Very exciting time for me, being apart of something from the beginning and seeing my hard work come together.",4
Busy,"Days were very busy, learned a lot in each position. Most co-workers were pleasant. Management had little experience managing large groups of people which often ended in conflicts among the team members and that created higher turn-over rates for different departments",3
a lot to learn but the work balance is not good,I have learned because Walmart is really a giant company. But the work culture there is not as good as I think. The coworkers there are kind of cool and nice.,4
Good Company and Great Associates,"Walmart is a great place to work.  The culture, work-life balance and size creates an energized and challenging place to accomplish personal and business goals.",4
Academically and technically challenging but satisfying.,"I usually start at 6 am ..1. Review email2. Verify scheduled meetings3. Draft up task to try to complete for the day4. Engage with task.5. Attend daily Agile Scrum status meeting with co-worker The hardest part of the job is staying on time with when there are external dependencies. Most enjoyable - Completing task within Agile sprints with a well test high performance package.",4
"Good Training, treated with respect, breaks, PRO, Insurance, Etc.","Given tools to be successful in the position.  Offered training and open door policy, There are scheduled breaks, lunch, and time off as needed.  There is plenty of work to keep you busy.",4
Team work,"Back when i was working at bruams i was doing drive thru and it was a busy day as usual so my crew and i were backed up and the customers where getting upset, so we all got together and came up with a plan to move the line faster. Took us about  20min to finish everything at the end of the day i learned that there is no ""I in team"" my manger and co-workers were pleased of how fast we worked as a team and from that day on yes we were still packed but we learned how to get the job done together.",4
Overall mediocre.,"The Color Technician position was not what I expected it to be.  It was somewhat tedious, however, my job performance was very good.  I compared color swatches for clothing.",3

Rewarding workplace with many opportunities,"Working with Walmart was a rewarding experience that allowed me to help a great number of customers, both in the office and in the stores. Each day, I was able to tackle situations that felt relevant and important. My co-workers were effective individually and  pulled together when needed to tackle tougher opportunities. My management team encouraged improvement and supported our processes. My experience taught me the basics of team leadership and many ways to improve my existing customer service skills. Collaborative problem solving, project management and technical writing are also some key skills I developed. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to change when it directly affected my department and projects that I had a stake in. Sometimes, entire priorities shifted due to these changes and that in turn changed the core of my day to day duties. Helping customers in a way that enabled them to be more effective and reduce their stress levels was something I looked forward to each day.",4
Met some great friends!!,"Met some great friends. There needs to be more focus on the associates and less on spending more money on opening more stores. The managers aren't able to manage due to not enough staff to the tasks, so they are forced to fill in as associate. It goes downhill from there. Unrealistic expectation of and no one to do the job. Then frustration boils over to staff that feels unappreciated. It is literally like a hamster on a wheel.",1
Overall decent company,"Great work/life balance in the tax department. However, turnover is high and career advancement or mobility can be unbending.",3
Decent work environment,"Worked here for 8 years.  Good pay (better than most in the area, considering what you do), good management team, climate controlled building, friendly people, etc. Walmart benefits are good, but need to be more affordable in some areas (health insurance needs some tweaking in my opinion). Very few advancement opportunities inside this facility though.

Terrible Company Completely,No respect for the individual like promised. No ability to move in the company like told. No job security. Bad management. Bad benefits. If you don't kiss butt you get nowhere. If you refuse to brain wash you go nowhere.,1
They don't have enough money for me to work there again,The General Office of this company is the worst place I've ever worked.  I started out in a store when I was 16 and that was ok for a part-time job.  When I finished college I transferred to the GO.  I hated it.  I dreaded going to work every day.  They lie to you and some managers don't treat their employees well.  There was nothing good about this place except they had a cafeteria with decent food.,1
Fundamentals of a Great Organization,"Executive leaders are champions for innovative thinking, inclusion, development, and taking risk.  This ideology does not trickle past the messy middle.

"big company, easy to get lost in the shuffle but there is a lot to be gained by working (in the home office) just get don't stay on night shift long","I was raised in Bentonville Arkansas, and walmart was always been a part of part of background life. my mother work for both the company as well as its vendors. its pretty much the only game in town. its a massive company that really wants to retain its small business roots. it fails at it more often than not though. parts of the company are great. from what I hear some of the stores are pretty good to work in but for the most part its middling to bad due to a lack of corporate oversight. on paper there is a lot of mutual respect and in the corporate offices its more than just words. its possible to have your voice heard even at the lower levels and the managers do fear being reported.  i worked night shift store support and if you get in on that level it an be good for a while at least. my advice is to get in the job and network as fast and as hard as you can, build skills as quickly, kick butt and push hard to get yo day shift. if you are on nights they will have you working some 12hr shifts and it can be killer.  i left to go live in California with my girlfriend and look for a job working tech out there. however i was so dragged out after just 8 months on nights that I put in my two weeks. there had been some new leadership about 2 months before I quit and that did play a major role in me leaving but if i had wanted to i could have stuck it out, reported the issues i had with him and how he was intimidating my team with right-ups and things would have changed. walmart very much want to be a good company but their bottom line get in the way of that. I would say - more...",4

The sky is the limit,Walmart has everything from custodial services to pilots. An individual can go as far as their desire takes them. The most difficult part of working for Walmart is the pace of change throughout the organization.,4
Walmart,Walmart is the largest retail corporation in the world. The career possibilities are endless. My time at Walmart was a pleasant experience as I was able to interact with different associates while serving their needs as a customer.

Stressful Work Environment,"I learned a great deal about the transportation and real estate business for a large retailer.  I liked my co-workers, but management seemed to be very inconsistent across departments and divisions.  The hardest part of the job was finding work/life balance and obtaining the recognition hourly employees deserved.  It appeared in some departments there were favorites and other outstanding employees were overlooked.  Most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job was the people I worked with and the community activities that Walmart was involved in.",3
Lacked a lot to be desired working in Information Systems,"The company gave me a wonderful opportunity to begin my career in Information Technology, but immediate managers seemed to look down on me due to having no degree even though my job performance was more than others possessing such degrees and certifications.",3
Uncontrolled Caos,As soon as I walked in it was non stop high pace activities all day.  Constant interruptions all day. Always working behind or having to do overtime to complete own task for agents.  Constant in and out of Call Agents.  I had no job security as it was a temporary agencies.,3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3
Would've benefited from having music playing,"The hardest part was trying to stay focused on my work when I could hear the other Call agents working around me, request being denied to listen to music when working Emails or working Offline all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped our Stores out to better serve our customers. For the most part I liked the people I worked with. Except I sat near someone that talked a lot to their neighbors in that row whenever they were not on the phone. I found that very distracting and I would get very irritated. I learned how the Walmart Stores worked. How customers would request Special orders from the stores. How we try our hardest to get the request fulfilled or find like items for the customers.",4
Awesome company!,"Biggest company in the world!  Great company to work for, very diverse and associates are very helpful. Walmart Associates practice 3 basic beliefs introduced by Sam Walton.  Walmart treat associates with respect and great benefits.",5
Working place,It is very nice to work with TCS employees . The TCS is building is good to work compare to Walmart ISD building. ISD is very conjugated place to work.,3
Optional courses to take,"Not a bad place to work, was much better for the first few years until our management changed.  Most people were friendly and willing to help each other out.  Used to have a lot of outside activities for employees until management decided we didn't need any at all.",3
Too many managers,"At Walmart I was a sales associate so I helped customers, cashiered, stocked shelves, designed mods, and more little stuff. The management stepped on each others toes too much  and it was hard to get a clear message to the associates because they were all saying something different. It was a decent job though.",3
Easy but repetitive tasks,"Would spend the majority of the shift straitening out aisles, other time was spent restocking and maintaining the backroom inventory. Occasionally asked to work other departments.",4

Na,Good stable company to work for.  Flexible hours and competitive pay.  Friendly atmosphere. Always room for advancement and growth with the company.,3
Customer-Service based work,"As a customer service manager, I run around like a chicken with its head cut off. It is extremely stressful, but I highly enjoy interacting with customers on a daily basis. Typically, every day entails something different. At this moment, our store is going through many changes so management has a hard time telling us what needs to be done. They all tell us differently. There is a large amount of tension and unnecessary drama on the front end between a few of my co-workers and it brings the environment down. However, the work itself is enjoyable. I enjoy my co-workers' presences, and I love when customers leave with a smile. I also love being a leader for all of the cashiers.",4
Work-Life Balance,Working for the Walmart Home Office gave me great experience working for a large retailer in the back-office side of accounting and finance. I learned a great deal pertaining to contracts and vendor relationships as well as SOX Compliance.,5

Great Company!,This place has a very diverse culture and plenty of room to grow. They are willing to help you find where you belong within the company. The management I've experienced thus far has been amazing. The only down side to this job from what I can tell is the strictness about you schedule when it comes to breaks and lunches. You are REQUIRED to take them. They are not lenient when it comes to skipping a 15 minute break because you are busy with your work. Other than that I love this company.,5
A Great Career Move,"Overall is a great place to work; however, it does depend on the management you have they can make or break your career at the company.",3
Rewarding place to work and learn.,Rewarding place to work and learn. Fun at times. Culture not as good as used to be. Leans to outside forces diluting core company principles. Has already and will continue to hurt company in the future.,3
Horrible,"Was with them for many years.  The first 8 or so were great.  Management at the top changed and so did philosophy.  All associates are disposable and expendable.  You are just a number.  No respect, thought or care for any associates.  Stress is unbearable.  Job is threatened daily.  The higher you move up, the worse it is.  Managers dropping like flies with strokes, heart attacks, suicides, etc.  When the management is miserable, this trickles down to the associates.  That's why you never see an associate at this company smiling.  They are all hating their jobs. Pay and benefits are fine, but they would get MUCH more bang for their buck with appreciating their people.",1
Good place to work,"I enjoy what I do. love customer service. I like taking care of other people. Doing so by paying their bills or wiring transferring money for them. Great team I work with. Manager is a Nice man. I just need to make more money. I lost my husband in April 2015. Now am totally responsible for me. l",4
Job environment very poor,"My experience at Walmart GSS-NA was very poor and stressful. Management ran things without honesty and integrity, and did not handle people or problems in a respectful manner. Every one on the team was micromanaged to the point of insanity. If you were not favored by the work flow or the supervisor, then you were looked over and regarded as unintelligent.  My experience with Walmart.com, however, was great. The team cared for each individual person, and the supervisor wanted you to excel in everything you did. It was a very uplifting and light hearted atmosphere.",3
Corporate office setting,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well.",3

Middle-ware and OS teams where never rewarded or recognized.created a lot of lifelong friends great team atmosphere. The worst part of the jobs is being on constant pager.",2
Great place with good people and lots of job options,I would stand at my scanner after having our start up meeting and streaches. i would take items and verify them on the computer for what it should be. if it didn't match up or i had any issues i would take it to a manager. i learned a lot about what goes on behind the scene at Walmart when an item is returned. Most all the co-workers where nice to work with and we usually had a good time working and talking.

It was just okay,"I've had three different positions at Walmart. I really liked the first two. I had control over my work and workflow. I got to learn about new computer systems. However the computer programs are all really old, like Microsoft Office 2007 old. At times, it can be really confusing. The rules and policies seem to change depending on the vendor.  For example, we will do X for this company, but not another company. There is a huge difference in how hourly and salary people are treated. The benefits are not the same. There is less opportunity as an hourly worker. This creates resentment in the workforce. So the thing I really liked about Walmart is how co-workers and other associates are willing to help you. I loved that. They do not want to see you fail. They are willing to work with you to get the job done.",3
"Great workplace, High Integrity, Development opportunities","Working at Walmart Global Shared Services was a wonderful experience. I started as an hourly associate and worked my way up to management. The leadership within the organization is very driven to creating an inclusive, fair, and ethical workplace.

Upper level management seems so busy and detached from daily happenings that they say one thing at a meeting and turn around and talk out of the other side of their mouth at a meeting a week later. It can be hard to keep up and gauge the asks of upper management.,4

Premier Concepts,"A typical day At Walmart is sometimes quiet, but any other day such as a holiday. It's usually busy with customers, and Walmart workers. I've learned that if I schedule myself to get up early and arrived to work two hours earlier that I can get a lot more work done. It's much easy for me to get with the morning managers that arrive. I need to check to make sure that my product is in the stores. The hardest part about my job is not to be able to help a customer. Although, I'm a vendor and I don't actually work for the store, I like to help customers find what their looking for. Most importantly I love the traveling. I get to see different faces everyday. I get to talk about my product to new and old managers. It' exciting.",4

A career here is hard to maintain,"Walmart touts family, as long as it does not interfere with their goals. There is a strong move to prevent 'associates' from being recognized individually for their good project outcomes, but on down the line, the managers get credit for the successes.There are meetings every day, which eat into a person's window of productivity. Managers are notorious for assigning far too many projects to each individual. If the individual falls into disfavor with the manager, he/she can use project completion failure as a means to get rid of the employee.The people generally on the floor are great to work with. However, they are hardly ever the ones who hire and fire.I learned that the farther up you go in the ranks, the more enemies you make. Most managers are micro-managers, stepping on your shoulders to get on up, and working the system where they are never to blame for failures.I liked the people I worked with. I had a great deal of respect for how hard they worked.",3

The culture there is better than some places I have to admit.  I also learned that if you're more into Buying and Merchandising this is the company for you.  But if you looking to be creative, or designing, then this is not the company for you.",3

Review,When you start your shift you start cleaning your workstation. If a customer comes up while you are cleaning you stop cleaning and take care of the customer.

I've gained a great deal of knowledge through this diverse company, the pace that we move projects through can be intense and this makes the job more exciting everyday.  The management is focused on assisting each manager/associate to reach their own full potential.   The hardest part of the job is understanding the volume and the multiple functions that each divisions responsibilities and how this all fits together with 2 million associates. The greatest part is seeing the value this business is for the communities they serve, and the company's goal of giving back to those communities with being a global leader in various actions.",4

Work has become ritualistic and the culture calcified with more years worked the essential badge of honor,"Lots of talk about innovation and change; however, it's more like the shouts of food from a starving man and water from a thirsty man.  Work for the majority has become ritualized with the 20% doing the work.  Little accountability which is supported by the musical chair of job rotation every 18 months.  Middle Management is weak although enough talent to bubble to the top.  The culture is calcified and can be a challenge for integration - learn the language which is a interesting mix of ITIL, Project Management and sprinkles of theology.  Nice people but many of the lifers will keep you at an arms length and subtly remind you that you are an outsider.  Over time their ISD group will be increasingly outsourced and migrate to the cloud.",2

Top Notch management and effective communication,"As a Workflow coordinator, my typical day began with compiling reports for metric building, overseeing a group of 20 associates to ensure workflow processes were being implemented and followed, conducting meetings and training where necessary and providing feedback to upper leadership about the team. Communication was very important and leadership always made sure that information was communicated to us as soon as possible. Their door was always open to address any concerns or ideas associate may have. I loved being a part of a team and part of a project that would be leading the company to one of their biggest financial decisions. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the constant changes and going back to the associates with those changes to be met with frustration and push back. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team. I had the pleasure of working with a wonderful group of people who brought different attributes to the team.",5

Management always offered feedback and really helped me improve and achieve promotions.  My co-workers respected my decisions, fairness and honesty.  They really make a good team great.

They were always willing to lend a hand in whatever that we needed help with. They made sure we were in direct connection with them on a daily basis. My co-workers were a fun group of people to work with. Very helpful and energetic. They made coming into work feel good. The hardest part of the job at first was the speaking in front of a group of people or managers in department meetings or small team meetings. But I have overcome that by the classes provided by the company. The most enjoyable part of this job was the department meetings with the whole team.

We did various team builders in these meetings and everyone kept it fun and comfortable.",5
A culture anchored by strong principles and driven by diversity.,"EVERYONE at Walmart is an entrepreneur.  Everyone is a Sam Walton to the degree that they can or want to be.  If you walk through Walmart Home Office on any given evening, Saturday, Sunday, you will see salaried member of staff putting in extra hours.  They are doing it to help a customer, to bring a project in ahead of time, or to test out some new idea.  Not because they have to, but because they view service to the customer and striving for excellence as entrepreneurial license.  Walmart employees are called “associates” because they are true business partners.  That partnership is what allows a company the size of Walmart to operate as well as it does. The culture is constantly nourished by good leaders who put in the extra time to get to know everyone on some personal level.  I once said that time spent at Walmart as an associate at any level is an incredible education.  You not only have access to leaders at every level, but they have access to you and take a genuine interest in your career.  They are interested in associates' ideas and in putting in the extra time to listen, and give practical feedback.  In fact, most leaders took the same view that I did:  If the associates around me weren’t presenting ideas, discussing, and arguing their cause, then I wasn’t getting my money’s worth.   I had more than a quarrel or two during my time there. Never about the goal; just about how to attain it, and I came away a better associate, regardless of the outcome. Most of the time at Walmart you are so immersed in the culture that you fail to appreciate it the way you should. - more...",5

The management style at Wal-Mart is very laid back, with an understanding of family and work/life balance.  They encourage all associates to grow their career with Wal-Mart.

Fun place to work but you worked!!!!,"I liked working at Wal - Mart .  While I was there I worked like a man which wasn't  a problem if I had gotten paid like the men.  Huge pay disparity for women in management other than that I had no problem but the Wal-Mart then is not the Wal-Mart of today.  The company actually cared about their people.  I have been to the Walton home twice.  I had met Sam Walton and Bud.  They believed in listening to their people.  I don't work there now but I am told it is not like that anymore. The day there was similar to that at Target, retail is detail only WM is not quite as neat at doing it.   The hardest part of the job was taking care of situations when the company was at fault.  You hated when something bad happened and the company could have taken care of it.

If you are someone that shows better ideas than other management or has the energy to create more work in order to make the environments more efficient - do not go to this company.

Walmart Review,"A typical day starts between 7:30-8:00 am.  You'll have an hour lunch most days, and the majority of the company leaves the office around 5:30.  It's a great place to work if you are looking for stability and a family oriented work culture. Management at Walmart is very good.  Managers are generally fair and try to stick to Walmart core values. Most of the Walmart working population is older.  There are a lot of long term Walmart associates and a lot of associates with families.  At this point in time, it seems that the talent pool of Walmart is weighted more toward midlevel managers than entry level positions. The hardest part of the job is probably the learning curve for understanding Walmart methods and processes. The most enjoyable part of the job is the attitude of the associates.  Most people are genuinely happy and are generally nice people.",4

They are exceptionally helpful, organized, friendly, and most importantly knowledgable on all current BSA/AML issues and regulations.

I would do all kinds of stuff from binning items to the steel to helping customers do carry outs which they have people to do that for. Management doesn't really help anything they just kind of laze around and tell you to do stuff that you're already doing. or they tell you to hurry up on stuff that should probably take a lot longer than anticipated. The co-workers were great, a bunch of people around my age with some of the same interests pretty great groups of people to work with.

Fun times,Got to remodle Walmart. I worked with a great crew and leader. We worked hard and had some fun doing it.,4
Do NOT work there..,This job is awful. The management doesn't care about you as a person at all. They lie to you and there is 0% chance of promotion unless you are their teachers pet. They change schedules with no notification and then accuse you of not showing up or else you come in then get sent home. You will have to work almost every weekend and only have off 1 major holiday in a calendar year.,2
Good company but not a good IT shop.,"Working in ISD is a pretty good place to end be.  The work is not too hard and the people are a good group to be around.

HQ's worst place to work for East or West Coast people,"Walmart is no longer transformational; it has lost its innovative drive and true customer centric focus. It is now a dying dinosaur, similar to Kmart and Sears. Here is what you should know...there is a lot of leadership infighting, there is an ""us vs. them"" struggle between the tenured associates and new experienced leaders from outside the company. Walmart's HR policies appear righteous on the surface but create an atmosphere of CYA and fear - investigations by ethics are the norm and you can be turned in ridiculous things like missing a meeting. Advancement opportunities are espoused during recruiting but are non-existent once you join.  Women - strong women are neither appreciated nor welcome - so if you join be sure to wear your ""I'm meek"" mask daily.  Single females get the worst treatment with discrimination and harassment.  Nearly everyone who has experience joins with stellar backgrounds and join betting it is a stepping stone to bigger jobs outside.  But in this economy, it is hard to find another job.  Avg time a person is stuck Walmart at is 3 - 5 years.  Finally the facilities and location are abysmal.  Buildings are former warehouses and are sub-par at best. The location is a rural town with few amenities and lots of farms. The closest city being Kansas City (3.5 hrs away) and Dallas (6 hours away).  My advice don't move for this job, it is not worth it.",1
Great place to work,"Plenty of large complex challenges, working with smart, motivated people from all over the world.",5

Travel Is a Must,"It was a great way to travel across the country setting up new stores and remodeling existing stores.  The only downside is 21 days away and 4 days home for up to 10 months a year.  Its a great opportunity for development for a young single person, and expands your horizons.",5
Super Busy!,Always a challenge. The goal of helping the customer before the end of the business day is part of company culture.,3
Daily grind,"Decent place to work.Average to below average pay for comparable industry jobs.Some great managers, some good managers, a lot of crummy managers.The daily grind definitely wears on you.  They all advocate working at a balls to the wall pace, juggling multiple projects and not letting any balls drop.Great corporate culture, good people to work with although you have to be good at playing office politics if you hope to advance.Stingy on holidays and vacation.Quaint community, on the very small side of things.  Feels somewhat isolated at time, particularly when you get snowed in and have to wait for the one snow plow in the county to make its way to your house.  If you thrive on the big city or night life you'll feel out of place here.",4

Non-Professional Enviroment,"I worked for the Wal-Mart home office System Division.  I resigned after two years of misrepresentations, non-advancement,  1-2% pay raises, Dull cubical based work environment.  Career growth through training or professional events are seldom available. The low wages and mandatory 50 hour work week makes this an unacceptable work environment.",2
High volume work environment.  Work can become repetive and monotonous.  Limited growth opportunities for Management level,"The  individuals you work along side as peers are great people with good hearts.  Low moral with senior management and cultural politics is difficult for management to deal with daily. At Walmart career growth is not just about who knows you but more about who likes  you.  Walmart thrives on internal relationships.  You can perform well or the best in your role but only  move forward if the right person in leadership champions you.  Its unfortunate for quite a few professionals. Flexibility to be is the best part of the job and working in a political environment or under unwritten rules is the worst part of working at Walmart. Walmart also does an excellent job of hiring minorities but not with keeping minorities and they do not do an excellent job of promoting management level minorities at the home office.",3

District manager, who was also a pharmacist, was very professional and fair. I loved my co-workers. We were like family.  We were able to have fun and get work done at the same time. The hardest part of the job was meeting KPI goals while at the same time trying to spend quality time with patients at consultation window and on the floor with questions about OTC medications. Conflict resolution was also a continuing challenge for me.  I had mixed success in that aspect of my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was those times when I would receive positive feedback from my patients.

Good place to work,"45 hour work week, but I think Wal-Mart is just more up-front about this than other companies. Once you work your 45 hours, you can be done with it. Worked as a team, learned a lot. They majorly outsource IT to WIPRO, lot's in-house also. Living in Bentonville has pro's and con's, the people are nice, all the basics, low cost of living, great if you love the outdoors with the Ozark mountains and lakes there.

"People are nice, but IT dept is not great, and location is boring","Location:Straight out of college, I started my software engineer career with Walmart and moved to Bentonville. Location isn't best suited for a single guy in his 20s - small town with locals or middle-aged folks, after a few weeks, you would start to run out of things to do. It's nice if you like hunting, outdoors, and playing at the park with your kids. It's also very inexpensive to live here, low house costs and other expenses. Culture:One of the first things you learn on the job is the Walmart Cheer, which to me is awkward and uncomfortable. It's suppose to instill a sense of pride in all the associates (employees), but it sort of has an opposite effect on me. ""Everyday low cost"" is a commonly used expression at Walmart, and they really mean it. The company is very cautious in every expenditure; as a result, employee salaries are a bit less, vacations are a bit less, and perks are a bit less. Instead of a regular work building, we all work in a very crowded, converted warehouse with no windows and all cubicles. Perhaps the execs just don't think spending that much money on a building is worth it. For some reason, Sams Club homeoffice building is much more modern, spacious, and beautiful. Work:I was hired a Java programmer, and i wanted to code and use skilled acquired in college. But the first major project they put me on was nothing related to programming - 3rd party software configuration. And when i finally started to code, instead of building software from the ground up, just auto-generated code with some code configuration to connect to databases and web - more...",3
Great company for family oriented programmers,A typical day at work is mostly geared in Java programming in my area. Sometimes you end up finding yourself doing to many extraneous tasks while trying to develop. A good example is having to press against other teams for assistance when project managers are not reaching out in your place for issues preventing you from continued focus. i.e. when you need infrastructure tasks completed you may find yourself chasing it down rather than the pm.,3

Stable Company,Fast paced environment; leading retailer globally with a lot of opportunities.,4
Hard work with great benefits.,My typical day included working fast to load boxes into trailers while meeting my production and all rules and regulations. I learned that it takes a special kind of person to do the jobs nobody likes. Management wasalways there and eaasy to talk to along with my co-workers. The harderst part of the job was the hours I worked. The best part was the great amount of pay I made.,5
Culture has been lost ,This company has lost track of the original mission and vision put in place by Sam Walton,3
Promotional opportunity,Daily work includes working with customers to resolve their computer needs. Periodically attending training courses to keep up to date with changing technologies. Management is supportive but could do better to thwart company politics in the promotions and hiring process. The hardest part of the job is making time to promote yourself through job shadows and networking. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction.,3
A great company to grow professionally as well as personally.  ,Overall excellent company. Looking to move forward within the company.,5
Demanding competitive workplace,"A typical work day starts around 7:15 AM and ends sometime after 5:30 PM.  Many days there isn't time for a lunch break so you eat on the run. It is a very aggressive competitive culture...the meek can be eaten alive.Successful managers are entrepreneurial in spirit and actions.Most co-workers are great...down to earth and really caring people.The hardest part of the job is the constant change and demand.The most enjoyable part of the job is bonus day.",3

You made the place what it was by your own ethics and attitudes. I had excellent ethics and my attitude was great, so for me it was an excellent place to be associated with. For me the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowning I was doing a good job for my managers and they knew they could always count on me for nothing less. The most difficult part of the job was moving around in the facility or advancement in your career because of the amount of coworkers that were there.

"This was a job that I enjoyed very much, given my 10+ years of drafting experience.","I worked with a great team, and as a management (salaried) employee, I was sort of my own man as far as breaks and lunch. My typical day at work was sitting at my desk and checking plans for technical correctness as they were passed back and forth to from the Walmart design team and the various consulting firms that produce the final construction documents. I learned that the workload and the pressure are much different on the client side of the business. The hardest part of the job for me was the workload and the short amount of time we had to turn around our product back to the consultants. My prior jobs had ben more laid back. The most enjoyable part was, without a doubt, the team I worked with. They were all great people and were always willing to lend a hand if needed. They were great teachers, too.",4

Not all of the jobs there are for everyone, but there are enough areas within the company that anyone can find something that they are interested in. The culture and values of the company are truly its foundation. As with any company large or small, you are going to find some people who are not fully immersed in the values and culture that Walmart was founded on.

Getting to know my team was my perk for the day.",5
"Overall, Walmart is a good place to work.","A typical day a work was one of many priorities and challenges, which I enjoyed. I learned so much about retail, merchandising and product development in my positions. Mangement seemed to be overwhelmed with responsibilities and there needed to be more time devoted to development of associates. The hardest part of the job was finding enough hours in my day to include more personal development and pursuit of advancement. The most enjoyable part of my job was being involved in the product development process -- finding and developing items to be placed in the stores.",3
Once was a fun place to work now not so much,Every Walmart I have been to says Walmart on the outside but is totally different on the inside!

The hardest part of the job was learning the Bulk Pharmacy processes, it was a newly added function to the department and the person who knew the job had transferred.

Save money. Live Better.,"Working for Wal-Mart Home Office is just about the same as you'd expect. A great working environment with a team emphasis, okay benefits and a discount card. But as great as it is there are also downsides. While their 3 basic beliefs keep everyone in a fair mood, there is also a fair share of arrogance and social disconnect in the corporation.Also living in NW Arkansas is nice but its also in the middle of nowhere, so when you get laid off it is very hard to find more work unless you have the finances to relocate.",4

It has allowed me to gain a lot of information about different areas of the company and has opened my eyes to many possibilities that the company has to offer.

Great Culture - Not So Great Benefits/Pay,"I learned a tremendous amount while working at Wal-Mart. I had the opportunity to get involved with various activities on the Corporate campus in addition to my day job.The culture is great and something you can get behind if you choose to ignore some individuals that can't seem to understand it. There were several employees that came from other companies that couldn't quite figure out or adjust to the Every Day Low Price mindset of the company.Pay is not great for internals and there are minimal opportunities to advance quickly unless you came from another company to Wal-Mart. There is a fairly large number of employees that willingly leave Wal-Mart to work for another company knowing they will come back to Wal-Mart b/c they negotiate a higher rate of pay if they become ""externals."" This tends to lower moral of individuals hoping to move up the ranks in Wal-Mart. It can be done - but in terms of doing it for better pay, you may have to wait much longer than if you had never worked for the company or if you had left and came back.Be prepared to work hard, but know that your hard work is making a difference. The company benefits many low income families.Interaction with all levels of employees is/can be high, even up to the CEO. Even hourly employees have carte blanche to schedule time to meet with executives and the CEO. The large company really can feel like a small family.",3
"Overall, a good company, caring for the community.","Management days are long and being flexible is a must. I enjoyed meeting new people and going to new places. Even though the work was essentialy the same, being in a new location always but a different spin on the same old work detail.",4

"Large company mindset, chance for advancement possible for some","Worked both in corporate offices and in store, will have to say it was a great learning experience, but after the death of Mr. Sam the company began to take on the 'Big Company' feel.

The co-workers I have worked with, some were easy to work with and others were not. I have learned not to focus on making friends but having business partners to work with was my goal for the job. The hardest part of my job was having to say No to a customer. No, if we are out of a product, No, if we can't take a product back because of its warranty, or an indirect No, to a customer if they are not serviced with a fast and friendly experience. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a smile on someone's face indicating appreciation.",3

Also, it allowed me to enhance my overall communication and leadership skills.The work environment is very flexible and encourages collaboration among different teams and divisions. However, projects or programs execution will vary subject to the team in which you operate. For example, Insights might focus more on long term strategy and Operations is usually more short term execution driven.The hardest part of the job is to influence and keep engage large teams (100 + associates) in order to ensure the success of a large scale program.The most enjoyable part of the job is to execute high impact initiatives that have a direct impact in the lives of our customers.

We were one team always helping each other when the need arose.

Opportunities for advancement for the right kind of person,"When leadership changes direction, you better hold on tight or run to keep up. The salary for most management positions is high compared to other jobs in this state. Just know that you'll be spending a lot more time at the office than with your family, and the dusty cubicles are far from cozy. Expect to go in early and leave late every single day. You'll spend countless hours in pointless meetings and hardly have time for lunch. Don't bother calling ISD when your laptop crashes. Just find the smartest guy in your department and beg for his help. Even if he's on vacation this week, it will still get done faster than going through ISD.You'll be expected to cheer at 7:30 during the Saturday morning meetings. You'll have a company phone attached to your hip at all times, and you'll be guaranteed never to work a standard 40-hour week. There are lots of opportunities to advance at Walmart if business is what drives you, but make sure that's really want you want in life and start looking for a backup plan anytime the CEO changes. You wouldn't be the first one they've ""involuntarily terminated"" after receiving 25 years of excellent evaluations.Some people seem truly happy there, and you may love it. I just think it's important to know what you're getting into on the front end. If you decide to interview for a position with Walmart, ask plenty of questions while you're there.",2
